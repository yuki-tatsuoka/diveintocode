       "[\"zero day leads you to think, even rethink why two boysyoung men would do what they did  commit mutual suicide via slaughtering their classmates. it captures what must be beyond a bizarre mode of being for two humans who have decided to withdraw from common civility in order to define their ownmutual world via coupled destruction.it is not a perfect movie but given what moneytime the filmmaker and actors had  it is a remarkable product. in terms of explaining the motives and actions of the two young suicidemurderers it is better than 'elephant'  in terms of being a film that gets under our 'rationalistic' skin it is a far, far better film than almost anything you are likely to see. flawed but honest with a terrible honesty.\",\n",
       " \"words can't describe how bad this movie is. i can't explain it by writing only. you have too see it for yourself to get at grip of how horrible a movie really can be. not that i recommend you to do that. there are so many clichés, mistakes (and all other negative things you can imagine) here that will just make you cry. to start with the technical first, there are a lot of mistakes regarding the airplane. i won't list them here, but just mention the coloring of the plane. they didn't even manage to show an airliner in the colors of a fictional airline, but instead used a 747 painted in the original boeing livery. very bad. the plot is stupid and has been done many times before, only much, much better. there are so many ridiculous moments here that i lost count of it really early. also, i was on the bad guys' side all the time in the movie, because the good guys were so stupid. executive decision should without a doubt be you're choice over this one, even the turbulencemovies are better. in fact, every other movie in the world is better than this one.\",\n",

       " \"i've just had the evidence that confirmed my suspicions. a bunch of kids, 14 to 22 put on the dvd of titanic on a fantastic state of the art mega screen home entertainment type deal. only two of them had actually seen it before. but they all had seen the moment of kate, leo and celine dion so many times that most of them felt they had seen the whole movie. shortly after the epic started, they started to get restless, some of them left asking the others  call us when the iceberg appears over an hour and a half into the movie, only the two girls who had seen the movie before, were still there. they started shouting: iceberg, iceberg. a stampede followed, they all came back to see the sinking of the titanic. they sat open mouthed, emitting ohs and far outs. so, just like i thought when the movie first burst into the scene. what is this one and a half hours waiting for the bloody thing to sink but what about the rest of the of it. dr. zivagho, for instance, had a similar running time, but think how much takes place in that film within the same period of time. in titanic leo teaches kate how to spit. look at the faces and hands of the, supposedly, creme de la creme in the first class dining room of the ship. look at the historical details, if you can find them. the storyline is so thin that they have to introduce guns and shootings in a ship that is about to sink. the real sinking here is of film standards. all the efforts are focus on special effects and opening week ends. the film went on to become the highest grossing movie of all time so, what do i know\",\n",
       " \"the movie was subpar, but this television pilot delivers a great springboard into what has become a scifi fans ideal program. the actors deliver and the special effects (for a television series) are spectacular. having an intelligent interesting script doesn't hurt either.stargate sg1 is currently one of my favorite programs.\",\n",
       " \"this movie has a special way of telling the story, at first i found it rather odd as it jumped through time and i had no idea whats happening.anyway the story line was although simple, but still very real and touching. you met someone the first time, you fell in love completely, but broke up at last and promoted a deadly agony. who hasn't go through this but we will never forget this kind of pain in our life. i would say i am rather touched as two actor has shown great performance in showing the love between the characters. i just wish that the story could be a happy ending.\",\n",
       " \"the single worst film i've ever seen in a theater. i saw this film at the austin film festival in 2004, and it blew my mind that this film was accepted to a festival. it was an interesting premise, and seemed like it could go somewhere, but just fell apart every time it tried to do anything. first of all, if you're going to do a musical, find someone with musical talent. the music consisted of cheesy piano playing that sounded like they were playing it on a stereo in the room they were filming. the lyrics were terribly written, and when they weren't obvious rhymes, they were groaninducing rhymes that showed how far they were stretching to try to make this movie work. and you'd think you'd find people who could sing when making a musical, right not in this case. luckily they were half talkinghalf singing in rhyme most of the time, but when they did sing it made me cringe. especially when they attempted to sing in harmony. and that just addresses the music. some of the acting was pretty good, but a lot of the dialog was terrible, as well as most of the scenes. they obviously didn't have enough coverage on the scenes, or they just had a bad editor, because they consistently jumped the line and used terrible choices while cutting the film. at least the director was willing to admit that no one wanted the script until they added the hook of making it a musical. i hope the investors make sure someone can write music before making the same mistake again.\",\n",
       " \"the plot of this terrible film is so convoluted i've put the spoiler warning up because i'm unsure if i'm giving anything away. the audience first sees some man in jack the ripper garb murder an old man in an alley a hundred years ago. then we're up to modern day and a young australian couple is looking for a house. we're given an unbelievably long tour of this house and the husband sees a figure in an old mirror. some 105 year old woman lived there. there are also large iron panels covering a wall in the den. an old fashioned straightrazor falls out when they're renovating and the husband keeps it. i guess he becomes possessed by the razor because he starts having weird dreams. oh yeah, the couple is unable to have a baby because the husband is firing blanks. some mold seems to be climbing up the wall after the couple removes the iron panels and the mold has the shape of a person. late in the story there is a plot about a large cache of money & the husband murders the body guard & a coworker and steals the money. his wife is suddenly pregnant. what the hell is going on who knows nothing is explained. was the 105 year old woman the child of the serial killer the baby sister why were iron panels put on the wall how would that keep the serial killer contained in the cellar was he locked down there by his family & starved to death or just concealed who is mr. hobbs and why is he so desperate to get the iron panels he's never seen again. why was the serial killer killing people we only see the one old man murdered. was there a pattern or motive or something why does the wife suddenly become pregnant is it the demon spawn of the serial killer has he managed to infiltrate the husband's semen and why, if the husband was able to subdue and murder a huge, burly security guard, is he unable to overpower his wife and just how powerful is the voltage system in australia that it would knock him across the room simply cutting a light wire and why does the wife stay in the house is she now possessed by the serial killer is the baby going to be the killer reincarnated this movie was such a frustrating experience i wanted to call my pbs station and ask for my money back the only enjoyable aspect of this story was seeing the husband running around in just his boxer shorts for a lot of the time, but even that couldn't redeem this muddled, incoherent mess.\",\n",

       " 'the germans all stand out in the open and get mowed down with a machine gun. the good guys never die, unless its for dramatic purposes. the plot has so many holes its laughable.

       " \"a lot people get hung up on this films tag as a children's film, and that it certainly is, though it is one made for adults. takashi miike uses the fantasy genre, particularly, the children's fantasy genre, as a springboard into the wild territory that is the great yokai war.the setup is simple a boy is selected to play the hero in this years annual festival, only to discover his role is much more real than he could have imagined. what follows is a hallucinatory, grotesque, whimsical, and often funny journey through the world of japanese folklore, but wait there's also an evil villain on the lose who wants to destroy the world. however, the villain here, is not a mere demon, it is the demonspirit of the accumulated resentment of those things which humans use and discard. usuing a chamber made out of pure liquid hateresentment, the villain transforms the vibrant colorful yokai spirits into soulless ten foot tall makeshift robots which chainsaw for arms and eyes like burning coals(those whove played the video game, sonic the hedghog, might remember a certain dr. robotnik performing similar procedures to the cute and cuddly's who sonic had to then liberate).the hero in this film is actually the least interesting character, essentially playing the straight man, in a world gone suddenly mad. though he does go through the typical heroes trials he more often than not cowers, as do many of the yokia themselves, who seem truly defenseless against the murderous robots, some spirits being umbrellas with eyes, talking walls, or creatures whose soul purpose in life is to count beans...of course in this magical world of miike's yokai war even beans take a magical power when one believes in them.in several ways this film subverts the normal conventions of children's fantasy, as few, if any, of the characters are heroic, their victory being a combination of happenstance, almost arbitrary faith, and a desire to party. the yokai spirits, only rally together and lay siege the villains hideout, after they mistake the end of the world invasion of earth for a great yokai festival, and even then only to dance and party. also the film ends not with the usual celebratory all's well that ends well fantasy ending, but with a final scene, showing our hero years older, with an adult job, now unable to see the yokai spirits of his youth, who then despondently turn to the villain, who being a spirit can never really die. this ending, with it's yokai spirit who is the spitting image of pokemon's pikachu, warns us not just of leaving behind our childhood selves, but of the horrors of overconsumption. the villain is resentment caused when humans no longer have reverence for the world and the objects around them(in japanese folklore nearly every object has some kind of spirit), and so when they are used and discarded as we in consumer societies do without reverence, they become soulless vengeful machines, not unlike those seen in modern video games, suggesting that though our imaginations and myths do not ever really die, but can become deformed.this is one of the first scripts miike has contributed to, and i believe it shows, as there's a tightness conceptually that sometimes gets swept under the rug by his exuberance for visual playfulness. though i've focused mostly on the story (since lots of users here seem to write it off), i do want to say that visually it's a kaleidescope of cgi, stop animation, costume, and live puppetry, that works remarkably well. there's a dreamlike quality to a lot of the film, and the miyazaki comparisons are warranted, as are the neverending story and labrynth comparisons, though this film is sharper and more adult than either. the yokai are beaten, brutalized, and turned into machines of living hate, who i believe even kill a few humans, a deformed aborted calf with a mans face is born and dies in the films grotesque opening, while a sexual undercurrent, the women with the long neck licking the face of our boy hero, or another characters persistent memory of touching the thigh of a young scantily clad water spirit as a boy, seem to linger a bit too long for most western tastes, especially when considering this is a children's film. however these are slight enough to catch adult attentions while minor enough, not to traumatize any children to bad. grims fairy tales, before revisions, did much worse, far more often.all and all this is one of miikes most accessible and engaging ventures yet, with enough visual drama and great performances(the yokai spirits have a humanism and an absurd humor to them, thats laugh out loud funny at times) to appeal to audiences of all ages, and a steady conceptual undercurrent strong enough to draw in an adult audience who have presumably brought their children or else come out of a sense of nostalgia for the long lost fantasy films of their youth. the latter group the film seems to address the most fervently asking that they not just continue passive consumption of the world around them, but show reverence to those spirits within them which seemed so much closer to reality in childhood. another beautiful, funny, and truly original film from a thrilling director who hasn't come close to his apex. instant classic.\",\n",

       " \"'shock corridor (1963)' was my first film from samuel fuller, and there i was impressed with the director's astute blending of bmovie and bigbudget aesthetics, even if the story itself was pure schlock. 'pickup on south street (1953)' was released a decade earlier in fuller's career, obviously produced on a larger budget from a bigname studio, twentieth centuryfox. nevertheless, the visuals are still notable in that there's a somewhat raw, naturalistic element to the photography, not unlike dassin's 'the night and the city (1950)' and kazan's 'panic in the streets (1950)' {the latter was also shot by cinematographer joe mcdonald}. in some scenes, fuller shoves the camera so close to his actors' faces that they're out of focus, bluntly registering the intimate thoughts, emotions and brief inflections that are communicated through that most revealing of facial features, the eye. though (unexpectedly) prone to melodrama, and with just a hint of anticommunist propaganda, 'pickup on south street' is a strong film noir that succeeds most outstandingly in its evocation of setting \\x96 the underground of new york city.when justoutofprison pickpocket skip mccoy (richard widmark) snags the purse of a woman on the subway (jean peters), he pockets more than he'd originally bargained for. the woman, candy, and her cowardly exboyfriend joey (richard kiley) had been smuggling topsecret information to the communists, and mckoy has unexpectedly retrieved an important roll of microfilm. will he turn in the macguffin to the proper authorities, or sell it to the highest bidder if 'pickup on south street' has a flaw, it's that the story seems designed solely to bolster an anticommunist agenda, reeking of propaganda like nothing since wwii {dwight taylor, who supplied the story, also notably wrote 'the thin man goes home (1944),' the only propagandistic movie of the series}. for no apparent reason, every identifiable character \\x96 even the smugly selfserving skip mccoy \\x96 eventually becomes a selfsacrificing patriot, the transformation predictable from the outset. in traditional film noir, the unapologetic criminal always gets his comeuppance, the rational punishment for his sins, but apparently not when they've served their country; patriotism wipes the slate clean.richard widmark, an actor who i'm really beginning to like, plays the haughty pickpocket with composure, though always with that hint of illease that suggests he's biting off more than he can chew. the opening scene on the train is the film's finest, as mccoy breathlessly and silently fishes around in his victim's hand bag, recalling bresson's 'pickpocket (1959).' thelma ritter is terrific as a tired streetwoman who'll peddle information to anybody willing to pay for it (though, of course, she draws the line at commies). jean peters is wellcast as the trashy dame passing information to the other side, playing the role almost completely devoid of glamour; fuller reportedly cast the actress on the observation that she had the slightly bowlegged strut of a prostitute. nevertheless, peters must suffer a contrived love affair with widmark that really brings down the film's attempts at realism. fascinatingly, upon its release, 'pickup on south street' was promptly condemned as communist propaganda by the fbi, and the communist party condemned it for being the exact opposite. go figure.\",\n",

       " \"i thought the movie (especially the plot) needs a lot of work. the elements of the movie remains westernized and untrue to the attempt of trying to produce an eastern feel in the movie. i'll give three out of many of the flaws of the movie:first, when shen told wendy that he would help her study the history of china, i was really happy that the audience would receive some information about chinese history; but it turns out that the movie did not exactly show wendy actually studying chinese history; yet instead, the movie only shows wendy practicing the method of remembering what she had studied, which frustrated and put me in dismay.second, which really bothered me, is how the characters kept mentioning about moon cakes  moon cakes this and moon cakes that and how good it tastes. yet they didn't really mention the real significance of it. the only they they talked about that had any relevance to the moon cake was the autumn festival, which they did not explain or go in depth. they could have mentioned the myth that correlates with the moon cake  the moon lady. the myth starts of with how there once exists ten suns and each would rotate rising, but one day all ten suns rose up, drying up the land with the rising intense heat; so the divine archer, hou yi, shot nine of the ten suns, leaving only one sun (there are different versions where the hou yi shot the eight out of nine suns). because of his heroic contribution, he was given the pill of immortality so he could live on forever in case the ten suns do rise up again, but his wife, chango stole it. after stealing it, she fled to the moon, where she met a hare. she then came upon an idea and told the hare to pound the pill into many piece so she could spread the pill all over earth, giving everyone immortality. (there are a few variations of this story but throughout my childhood, i, most of the time, heard about this version). i thought details such as this would make the plot more culturally chinese oriented.the last thing i would point out is the last battle scene of the movie. the teachers that were possessed by the monks were fighting the terracotta warriors (the lifelike statues of the soldiers) went against the idea of how important chinese history is to the chinese. the terracotta warrors serves as a connection of china's past and it was very westernized (where evil must be killed in anyway possible) that the monks in the movies were willing to destroy that connection. it would be understandable if wendy, considering she is chineseamerican and doesn't have full chinese knowledge, had no problem destroying these priceless artifacts.the whole movie was westernized because it seemed that all the monks and shen want to do is fight... i mean, it's rated tvpg due to violence, which goes against the confucius thinking of cooperation and harmony. it would seem more accurate that the monks try to avoid violence and try to work things out peacefully before having to resort to violence.all in all, all of or either of the producer, writer, or director did not do their research thoroughly and did a messy and effortless job instead. i would suggest that they either stop airing this movie or that they reshoot the movie so it contains more accurate information; however, i would give it credit (2 stars) for removing one stereotype of asians and asianamericans of being smart and quiet.\",\n",

       " \"i read several mixed reviews and several of them downright trashed the movie. i originally became interested in this project because it was being directed by tony scott and i have become very interested in his work after man on fire had such a profound impact on me. before i start my review, let me first say this...it's wonderful to see that this movie could have been told in a boring and ordinary manner, yet the writers and scott chose a different approach.plot:simply stated, it's not boring. most hollywood movies give 'tried and true' plots that they know will connect with people, often ensuring the audiences acceptance of the film and creating a higher probability of profit. this plot was one of the more interesting ones i had seen in a while. just for reference, i recently watched 'the weather man' and 'lord of war' and while i will say that these movies are excellent, and i enjoyed them both tremendously, both the plots in these movies are boring and they are told exactly how you would expect them to be told. they don't take any chances whatsoever, and they are extremely predictable after you've watched a fair amount of american films. domino's plot is both interesting and told in a manner that keeps you thinking, oh man, they're screwed now. and i feel that has been lacking in a lot of recent films. it has a lot of depth to it, in my opinion, and gives you plenty of things to question while watching it. overall, this is what kept me so interested in the movie.characters:i felt that the characters were accurate. knightley did a wonderful job of portraying a beautiful woman, who was anything but on the inside and wanted to be viewed as what she was. it was obvious that she wanted to prove herself and she took whatever means she had to accomplish that.choco was also very believable, his use of spanish in inappropriate situations, his reactions to domino's lack of affection, as well as his jealousy issues within the team...they all rang true to me, which made me feel that his character was that much more realistic.rourke's character was the least interesting to me, but it still rang true to me. he seemed like an ordinary guy, trying to make ends meet. i hope that's what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with him because that's what i got out of it. he did a very good job of showing ed in an average joe kind of way that has made his mistakes, yet is still trying to live.claremontladies: i believe that they provided much needed 'heart' to the story. they weren't just people who are out getting money to buy a bentley, these were real people who had a real problem and they sought others mean to accomplish that goal. you could empathize with them because, to them, this child's illness was a problem with no other solution. these characters were supposed to show real people who are less fortunate who got into this mess because they needed help.the mobsters: they made the story seem sinister in a way that only the mob can. and i really liked that part. they also padded the story with small intricacies that made the plot that much more interesting.christopher walken90210 guys:they provided the comic relief in an otherwise very serious movie. from walken's awkward statements to the ceaseless references to the 90210 guys being hasbeens. their involvement in the movie only made it that much more enjoyable.cinematography....yes....the cinematography. this is where this movie seems to have lost a lot of potential fans. but in my opinion i thought it was genius, the use of the camera to translate the mood of the current situation was extremely effective in my opinion. i considered it a method that was properly realized but could always use improvement, just like anything else. i both applaud and congratulate scott, the editor, the cinematographer and the director of photography on taking some real chances with this movie. not only did they go far and above with its presentation, they went that much further. the use of colors, both extremely light and extremely dark provided the 'look' of the film with a sinister and grungy look that accurately depicts the life of the mob, bounty hunters and the less fortunate in a manner that show that their life isn't as peachy or 'clean' as everyone else. if you notice, in times of less stress or conflict, there were very few camera tricks if any at all. this shows that scott and his crew were trying to achieve something with this look and weren't just doing it for the heck of it. i realize that most people who watched this movie weren't expecting it and it cause many of them to be turned off to this film but i think it was great that scott took this approach. hollywood films have grown predictable and bland. most of them are shot in the same manner with the same twists and turns. and i'm glad that scott tried to make something different.granted, this movie isn't for everyone, but to say it's trash and has nothing to offer is completely missing the point. i thoroughly enjoyed this film and i'm glad that i spent the money for it. i would recommend this to all, but i'm sure it will only hit a chord with few. i must agree with an earlier poster when he said that many of those who refuse to see outside the 'sphere of mtv' won't appreciate this movie, but i think many people will. we should all try to enjoy it for the fact that scott and co. took some chances and tried to deliver something that was different and unique. and with that in mind, i think he succeeded tremendously.\",\n",

       " \"the actual crime story at the core of in cold blood might seem a little 'tame' for those who are weened on the classic serial killer stories (gein, bundy, dahmer), or just the more notorious cases out in hollywood (oj, manson). the essential facts in the case don't amount to anything terribly convoluted: perry smith and dick hickock (here played by robert blake and scott wilson respectively) met by some luck, conspired to rob a man's farmhouse safe out in kansas, and after killing a family of four with a shotgun and dagger came away with 43 dollars. aside from their returning to the us after fleeing briefly to mexico, there isn't a whole lot of mystery to the resolution either. they were caught by some stroke of ironic chance (a cop followed them and stopped them for having a stolen car after smith and hickcock helped out a boy and his old man collecting bottles for change), and sentenced to hang by the neck until dead. the story ended in 1965.but it's the handling of the story, moments of moot, the performances, a pure cinematic touch that brooks and his absolutely marvelous (the lategreat) dp conrad hall provides in crisp widescreen black and white, and a storytelling style that feels realistic without going into too much naturalism or too much melodrama (save perhaps for near the end, which is pitch perfect). the air of tragedy hangs over the story, and not so much because of the killings themselves, no matter how brutal they are as the third man that is conjured up, as the narrator observes, by smith and hickcock teaming up, but because of the inevitability of the story. you feel somehow for these criminals, who in any other hands would be just be conventional figures or something out of a bmovie. these aren't good people, but they aren't necessarily monsters either, at least all the way through.it's also an excellent 'roadmovie' as we see smith and hickcock on the road down to the clutter residence (the actual nighttime scene of the crime taking place late in the film), then on to mexico, then back to america towards las vegas. we get to soak in the personalities of these two, probably even more than that of the police detectives who at first have no leads and then finally get a break with an inmate. it's actually kind of disturbing to get this close to these two (sort of akin to the aimless quality of malick's badlands characters), and it's also a sign of daring for the period. there's no sermonizing, like he did this because of that and this or the other. we see how smith had an abusive, psychotic father, but that smith loved and hated him. the complexity there is too much for the movie, maybe even too much for capote's book (which, i should confess, i've still yet to read, though i plan to). and we see hickcock is this creature of slick confidence (i.e. getting the suit and other things with bad checks), but without any deeprooted explanation to it all.the streak of fatalism in in cold blood is some of the starkest of the 60s, and it's the luck of brooks to have its stars as blake in his topofthepops performance (this and lost highway, oddly enough considering his real life saga in recent years, his quintessential pieces of work), and wilson's breakthrough before becoming a character actor. while they're surrounded by fine supporting work, they themselves are eerily absorbing, driven more or less by greed and fantasies of escapism with treasure, and staying pretty much grounded in their situation through the death row and on through their ends. is this a morale of the story, if there could be one, that it's more horrifying to confront the possibility that those who kill can't be classified, of good vs evil getting smudged smith apologized for his crime before being hung, and he points out, but to who this is a story bound to give the most hardened fans of truecrime the bonafide chills, and it's quite possibly the best american film of 1967.\",\n",

       " \"i have this movie on dvd and must have watched it thirty times by now. i must really love it, right well, not really.i was a surfer earlier in my life, and i loved the sport. to this day, i am fascinated by good surfing. riding giants has plenty of that, and thus i am a sucker for the thing. but i definitely have some bones to pick with it. (peralta, you listening).first, the movie has too little faith in its subject matter. the cutting and editing of the waves is such that the majority of them are sort of ruined. very, very few waves are actually shown ridden from start to finish. peralta seems addicted to a hyper kinetic, cutandpace method. it gets especially bad in the middle section on the spot mavericks in northern california. not a single wave is ridden start to finish. almost the entire section on mavericks (one third of the movie) is a jarring montage of clips with an equally jarring soundtrack. i can understand the effect peralta was trying to achieve with mavericks, as the place is a truly frightening mix of bone crushing waves in frigid open ocean chop, but he goes way too far. mavericks is not just a bad acid trip. waves are actually ridden there, even with great performances. it would have been good to see some of them. if peralta thinks this is a grand sport (and i am sure he does), then why does he insist on messing with the subject matter so much at times, the editing reduces the movie to the inscrutable. there is one fast clip in the section on peahi in hawaii, which i still cannot understand. even if i run it on slow motion on dvd, the image is too fast to be decipherable. it must be a couple of frames in length at the max.second, have the guys who made this thing ever learned about understatement it is particularly galling to watch the narrated directors' version on dvd. these guys sound like two overthetop valley girls. the same sentiment shows up in the main production. every thing is always so goddamn amazing etc. one character in particular is just plain obnoxious  sam george, the editor of surfer magazine, who is practically peeing in his pants every time he has anything to say. he is a super drag on the movie.there is a tremendous amount of effort that went into this movie. i mean, just to get the old movie shots they have, and also, all of the interviews. the movie is a great story, and i think it is generally captivating entertainment. thematically it is well laid out, with the three parts centering around greg noll, jeff clark, and laird hamilton respectively. there are some uses of still photography that are phenomenal. in the directors' narration, they say it is a new type of 3d technology, and it really works. the three principle characters shine, both in their interviews and in the water. as an athlete, laird hamilton is a revelation. he rises to the pinnacle of his sport in a way that i have only seen michael jordan do in basketball. and too, the story of his meeting his father is a gem. it really touched me.it is just that the movie could have been so much more. the very last part of the movie, when the credits roll, gives a hint of what it could have been. there are some beautiful panoramic shots of waves with a magnificent soundtrack. (the soundtrack in the rest of the movie is rubbish, though you may like it if you are fan of the modern, frenetic school of rock.) anyway there's my two cents...\",\n",

       " \"in iran, women are not permitted to attend men's sporting events, apparently to protect them from all the cursing and foul language they might hear emanating from the male fans (so since men can't restrain or behave themselves, women are forced to suffer. go figure.). offside tells the tale of a half dozen or so young women who, dressed like men, attempt to sneak into the highstakes match between iran and bahrain that, in 2005, qualified iran to go to the world cup (the movie was actually filmed in large part during that game).offside is a sliceoflife comedy that will remind you of all those great humanistic films (the shop on main street, loves of a blonde, closely watched trains etc.) that flowed out of communist czechoslovakia as part of the prague miracle in the mid 1960's. as with many of those works, offside is more concerned with observing life than with devising any kind of elaborately contrived fictional narrative. indeed, it is the simplicity of the setup and the naturalism of the style that make the movie so effective.once their ruse is discovered, the girls are corralled into a small pen right outside the stadium where they can hear the raucous cheering emanating from the game inside. stuck where they are, all they can do is plead with the security guards to let them go in, guards who are basically bumbling, goodnatured lads who are compelled to do their duty as a part of their compulsory military service. even most of the men going into the stadium don't seem particularly perturbed at the thought of these women being allowed in. still the prohibition persists. yet, how can one not be impressed by the very real courage and spunk displayed by these women as they go up against a system that continues to enforce such a ridiculously regressive and archaic restriction and, yet, the purpose of these women is not to rally behind a cause or to make a point. they are simply obsessed fans with a burning desire to watch a soccer game and, like all the men in the country, cheer on their team.it's hard to tell just how much of the dialogue is scripted and how much of it is extemporaneous, but, in either case, the actors, with their marvelously expressive faces, do a magnificent job making each moment seem utterly real and convincing. mohammad kheirabadi and shayesteh irani are notable standouts in a uniformly excellent cast. the structure of the film is also very loose and freeform, as writerdirector jafar panahi and cowriter shadmehr rastin focus for a few brief moments on one or two of the characters, then move smoothly and effortlessly onto others. with this documentarytype approach, we come to feel as if we are witnessing an actual event unfolding in real time. very often, it's quite easy for us to forget we're actually watching a movie.it was a very smart move on the part of the filmmakers to include so much goodnatured humor in the film (it's what the czech filmmakers did as well), the better to point up the utter absurdity of the situation and broaden the appeal of the film for audiences both domestic and foreign. offside is obviously a cry for justice, but it is one that is made all the more effective by its refusal to make of its story a heavybreathing tragedy. instead, it realizes that nothing breaks down social barriers quite as efficiently as humor and an appeal to the audience's common humanity. and isn't that what true art is supposed to be all about in its own quiet, understated way, offside is one of the great, underappreciated gems of 2007.\",\n",

       " \"this is a film that takes some digesting. on the one hand, we are offered a tough outward shell, a story that does not only derive the catholic church, but does so foolishly, and uninformed. on an inner layer, we are offered a story of orthodoxy over orthopraxis, and what happens when people follow blindly a faith that they must not understand.at first glance, it appeared this was supposed to be a comedy. if so, then mr. durang needs to open a dictionary, because he clearly does not know the meaning of the word. the jokes are pale; the humor is awkward and poorly delivered. in particular, ms. keaton's performance is flighty and over the top, well below the quality of her annie hall and sleeper days. jennifer tilly is again the model of stridence, with her hipitched voice and whining style. all of this could be forgiven if it weren't for the last 20 minutes of this movie, that evidently was a controversial play made in 1981.***careful, spoilers ahead***it all starts with the appearance of four former students of sister mary ignatius (ignatius, by the way, is a male name, and a nun would not adopt it after her vows under any circumstance simply due to that fact, just to show you how much tireless research went into the project to begin with.) when they all admit that they don't live up to the church's teachings, the sister proceeds to become irrational and abuse them in a manner the audience is to believe she did way back when in the corny, alltoocliché sepiatone flashbacks. when one of them admits to having two abortions, the nun becomes even more abusive, until the pupil pulls out a gun. after wrestling it away from her, the nun kills the pupil, presumably in selfdefense. she then goes on a screaming rampage, killing a gay former student because of his sins. the last shot is of the dead female pupil lying in a christlike pose as a shadow of a cross hangs over her. can you say `heavy handed' i knew you couldi know there have been abusive nuns in the past, and i know many people have been emotionally harmed as a result, but this imagery is fed down our throats in almost every other shot in this train wreck of a movie. i have heard from the writer and the director that this is a film about hysteria and why one should not follow the orthodoxy so religiously, no pun intended. this explanation is hard to swallow, though, simply because we are never given an authoritative viewpoint that is not biased against the catholic faith in one way or another. this film is simply anticatholic tripe, which in the name of fairness and equality, is mean spirited and hateful.this is a film i would recommend for a catholic, namely to awaken him or her to the realities of what cynicism and ignorance they face today. if it were `rabbi ray explains it all' or `imam muhammad explains it all', there would be rioting in the streets and showtime would lose all of its subscription. but, sadly, because this is a film that strikes out against what is perceived to be the majority, it is accepted and even applauded by those who share the same spiteful point of view.i certainly hope every member of that cast was a practicing catholic, so it wasn't just ignorance that brought them to make this film.i give it 1.5 stars out of 5, not because of its offensive nature, but because it was poorly written, poorly directed and just a bad movie in general. don't even waste your time.\",\n",

       " \"this has to be some of the worst direction i've seen. the closeup can be a very powerful shot, but when every scene consists of nothing but closeups, it loses all its impact. tony scott has some very beautiful scenery to work with, the backdrops of mexico, the cantinas, the beautiful estate where anthony quinn lives, and the dusty towns costner rolls through on his journey for revenge. unfortunately we only catch quick glimpses of these places before the camera cuts to a picture of a big, giant head. even the transition scenes where costner is driving alone across mexico quickly cut to a closeup. the score is overdramatic and intrusive, dictating every emotion we should feel. the story itself should have been handled much better. among other things, too many people pop up out of nowhere to help costner along  it's just bad writing. it's a typical thriller storyline, but many others have taken the same premise and done outstanding things with it. costner's no way out had a somewhat similar storyline, but it was a much better movie. the ending was completely anticlimactic and suffered from the most melodramatic scoring of the film. this movie was never going to be great, but if we saw more of mexico and less of giant heads this film might have been watchable.\",\n",

       " \"wisecracker, the biography of actor william haines, offers a gratifying anecdote about the former star when he was past 70 and long retired from making movies. the old gent was not sentimental and rarely watched his own films, but in 1972 he was persuaded to attend a los angeles museum screening of show people, the late silent feature in which he costarred with marion davies. beforehand, haines was worried that this comedy would provoke the wrong kind of laughter, but he was pleasantly surprised (and no doubt relieved) at how well it held up and how much the young audience enjoyed it. watch the film today and you can see why: show people is a delightful hollywood satire that retains its charm because it lampoons its targets with wit and flair, yet without malice. it's still funny and its satirical points still resonate. needless to say, the technology of moviemaking has changed vastly since the silent days, but the pretensions and follies of the filmmakers themselves haven't changed all that much.show people also stands as the best surviving work of marion davies, a firstrate comic performer who deserves a prominent place in the pantheon of great comediennes. where her career was concerned davies was both blessed and cursed by the patronage of her paramour, the newspaper magnate william randolph hearst. it's well known that hearst exerted enormous influence over davies' choice of roles, and well known too that, despite her gift for comedy, he preferred to see her play dignified heroines in period costume dramas. by the late '20s, for whatever reason, marion was permitted to strut her stuff in several exuberant light comedies (including the red mill and the patsy), but show people, directed by the great king vidor, stands as her most enjoyable showcase. william haines gives an engaging, likable performance as her boyfriend and costar billy boone, but this is the leading lady's show all the way.marion plays southern belle peggy pepper, an aspiring actress who storms hollywood accompanied by her father, determined to become a movie star. (her dad colonel pepper is played by actordirector dell henderson, a veteran of griffith's biograph dramas who\\x97coincidentally\\x97resembled hearst) one of marion's funniest bits, often excerpted elsewhere, is her audition at the comet studio casting office. while dad helpfully suggests emotions to portray (sorrow . . . joy) and drops a handkerchief across her face, peggy assumes the appropriate expression and posture. she's hired, only to discover that comet makes lowbrow comedies, the kind of comedies where people squirt each other with seltzer and inept cops tumble over each other racing to the rescue. of course, comet is intended as a takeoff of mack sennett's keystone, but the true nature of the satire becomes clear as the story unfolds. as peggy pepper rises in the movie star hierarchy she leaves comet for the more prestigious high art studio, assuming the name patricia peppoire as more befitting her new station in life as a serious actress. at some point it may occur to us (as it surely did to viewers in 1928) that davies' rival gloria swanson started out in keystone comedies before rising to prominence in serious dramas for cecil b. demille. and as miss peppoire takes herself more and more seriously, giving the highhat treatment to former colleagues such as lowly comic billy boone, davies' performance takes on an element of wicked parody seemingly aimed squarely at swanson herself. this is especially notable during an interview sequence, when miss peppoire's spokesman spouts pretentious nonsense while the star delivers a spoton impersonation of swanson. i suppose this was intended as a friendly spoof, but i have to wonder how friendly relations were between gloria and marion after this movie was released.in any event, show people is a delicious treat for buffs, who will relish the parade of star cameos throughout. charlie chaplin contributes a nice bit, sans makeup and looking quite distinguished, eagerly seeking patricia peppoire's autograph (and in a show of good sportsmanship marion davies herself puts in a selfmocking cameo appearance, evening the score for poking fun at swanson by poking fun at herself.) this is a silent film that viewers not especially attuned to silents might appreciate, at least those viewers with a taste for movies about the movie business. show people surely belongs in the company of such classics as sunset boulevard and singin' in the rain, among hollywood's most expertly produced, enjoyable exercises in amused selfexamination.\",\n",

       " \"this movie is not a kung fu movie. this is a comedy about kung fu. and if, before making this film, sammo hung hadn't spent some time watching films by the great french comic filmmaker jaques tati (i.ie., e.g., esp. jour de fête), he is certainly on the same wave length.personally, i think tati's films are hilarious; but they're not to all tastes. some have told me that they loathe his work. i've never figured out why, but i think it's because the character that tati usually plays himself is so totally dead pan, so unaffected by the events around him (which he is usually causing) that many miss the more subtle comic bits happening around him.at any rate, tati's main shtick  or at least his best known  is to take a pretentiously upright petite bourgeoisie with 19th century sensibilities and drop him into 20th century france where he must confront a society that is largely defined by the gradual eroding of those sensibilities. he usually has serious difficulties with little things like record players or radios. he's a hazard in a car, but the world's no safer when he rides a bicycle. but through it all, he never loses his aplomb, which is derived from his inner recognition that the nineteenth century was more interesting than the 20th overall.in a similar fashion, the character sammo hung himself plays is a country boy come to the big city of hong kong, utterly convinced that what makes the city interesting is that bruce lee made kung fu movies there. this gets him into trouble in small ways, since he takes in stride happenstance which would never be noticed in a small town but which are deemed inappropriate in a big city  such as the moment when he appears to be urinating in the street, a cop stops him, only to discover that hung is actually just squeezing water out of his shirt, soaked during an accidental dip in the bay. what's interesting about this gag is why it is hung doesn't understand what the cop's fuss is all about  in a country town, as long as no one's looking, if you gotta go you gotta go. in other words, hung is not really urinating in the street  but he certainly would  and what's the problem officer of course hung's obsession with bruce lee also gets him into big troubles as well. he beats a gang of thugs who have refused to pay his restaurantowner uncle. of course, in a bruce lee movie, the thugs would be considered trounced, and they would have learned their lesson. but in hung's hong kong, reality unfortunately prevails, and the thugs return when he's not around, to trounce his uncle.of course, hung finally triumphs in the end, just as tati always did. characters like this must always triumph (at least in comedy) because they are completely innocent, and as such, despite their comic missteps and misunderstandings, they really represent what is best in the humans we admire and wish to be. we don't really want to be bruce lee (who has to experience the loss of all of his friends before he gets a chance to beat the badguy), we, in our own innocence, really want a world where lee's heroics are possible.unfortunately, that world only exists on film.ah, but what if...  and in that question we find sammo hung at his comic best.\",\n",

       " \"kabei: our mother (2008) is a poetic and sublime beauty from japan. a real weeper i had heard great reviews for the film and rented it from netflix. am i glad i did in many ways this film reminded me of the old style of japanese classic filmmaking from the 1940's and 1950's that i've come to love so much, such as seen in yasujiro ozu pictures  the title credits even begin in the same way, with the japanese letters (characters) in red against neutral color burlap material. i immediately thought: this director loves ozu. the same style was used too: mostly indoor sets with only a few outdoor scenes. even a couple of pillow shots, as roger ebert calls them. the strength of the film is built on the love of the characters for one another.the story follows the lives of a japanese family before, and during, and after, world war two. the mother takes care of her growing girls the best she can after the father (a university professor) is arrested for antiwar sympathies. he's never freed and only has a few brief meetings with his wife in prison before he dies of starvation and disease. meanwhile a former student of the professor comes by often to help take care of the mother and two girls. he begins to fall in love with the mother and is a substitute father for the two girls. but war starts and he's drafted and they have to say an abrupt farewell. will they ever express their love for one another will he ever return from the war there is so much heart and gentle spirit in the performance of the lead actress, sayuri yoshinaga. she's almost a madonna type, she's so beautiful big soulful eyes and flawless skin. the actor who plays the student is phenomenal as well: his name is tadanobu asano. what a sensitive performance. there is no macho in him at all; he's gentle and kind. i'd certainly love to see both of these two in other movies. i think i'll check to see what's available for them. the two little child actresses are wonderful too.the film is just released on ntsc dvd for american audiences, with very easy to read english subtitles. i gave it a 10 out of 10 on the imdb. i cried almost as much as with the japanese film classic twentyfour eyes (1954). don't miss this film\",\n",

       " \"this movie was recently released on dvd in the us and i finally got the chance to see this hardtofind gem. it even came with original theatrical previews of other italian horror classics like spasmo and beyond the darkness. unfortunately, the previews were the best thing about this movie.zombi 3 in a bizarre way is actually linked to the infamous lucio fulci zombie franchise which began in 1979. similarly compared to zombie, zombi 3 consists of a threadbare plot and a handful of extremely bad actors that keeps this 'horror' trash barely afloat. the gore is nearly nonexistent (unless one is frightened of people running around with green moss on their faces) and the english dubbing is a notch below embarrassing.the plot this time around involves some sort of covert military operation with a bunch of inept scientists (ie. an idiotic male and his stupid female sidekick) who are developing some sort of chemical called death one that is supposed to reanimate the dead. unless my ears need to be checked, i don't even recall a reason for the research of death one. it seems to exist only to wreak havoc upon the poor souls who made the mistake of choosing to 'star' in this cinematic laughfest.anyway, death one is experimented on a corpse (whom i swear looked like yul brynner), and after it is injected into his system, he sits upright and his head explodes the sound effects are also quite hilarious  as the corpse's face bubbles with green slime, the sound of 'paper crumpling' can be heard. the death one toxin is transported outside and is 'hijacked' by a group of thieves where one makes off with it, but infects himself after cutting himself on an exposed vial.needless to say, the guy turns into a zombie, but not before he makes his timely escape to a cheap motel, infects a lowly porter and murders a maid by pushing her face into a bathroom mirror(). the military catch wind of this and immediately take action before 'eliminating' everyone who is unlucky enough to be within the 'contamination zone' and turn the motel upside down. they find the infected thief and burn his body, only to have the smoke infect a flock of birds that are flying over the chimney stack().we cut to the introduction of a group of men who are on leave from the army, listening to 'groovy music' that is coming out of a little dinky boombox while trailing a trailerload of slutty girls who are leaning out of the windows and showing off their chests. can someone say zombie food we also have a subplot involving a girl and her boyfriend driving a car who stop to inspect a group of birds lying on the road... the same birds that were infected by the 'zombie' smoke the birds attack the boyfriend and the girl drives off to a deserted gas station to seek water. this is one of the most incredibly hilarious moments of the movie. she walks around this old dirty, rusty and obviously abandoned building where she continues to ask aloud, hello is there anyone here please, i just need some water she encounters a group of zombies, one of which is chained to a wall () and the other is swinging a machete. after a bit of rumbling and tumbling around on the ground, she escapes but not before blowing up the gas station with her lighter.meanwhile, the birds attack the trailerload of whores and one girl gets pecked and infected. they all pull up to the same motel where the original infection took place, and this is where the second most hilarious moment of the film takes place. after a matter of hours (a day at the most), the same motel is now caked in dust, has vines growing throughout it, and looks like it has been sitting derelict for years. anyway, what better place to take refuge than this particular building needless to say, the group begins to break down as several people walk off together to get themselves stuck in an incredibly stupid situation involving a zombie attack.the third most hilarious moment concerns a man and a woman who explore a deserted village, of which the woman comments, this place is a dump she then proceeds to get 'pushed' off a balcony by a zombie into pirahna() infested water where she has her legs bitten off and turns into a zombie within seconds meanwhile, her friend back at the motel who got pecked and infected hours earlier is still turning into a zombieunfortunately, there are just too many inconsistencies in this movie that makes this movie just too stupid for words. for example, the time rate concerning infected people being 'zombified' differs greatly. sometimes it takes seconds, other times it takes hours. some zombies run, others drag their feet and walk really slow. some even do kungfu moves, while others hide under stacks of hay to surprise people. some of the zombies even talk the funniest moment of course is the infamous 'zombie head in the fridge' gag which 'elevates' itself in midair and 'attacks' a stupid man who goes looking for food. funnily enough, his girlfriend gets her throat torn out by it's 'headless' counterpart (lmao).the biggest disappointment for me though was the lack of storylines involving the people who are in fact killed by zombies. we never get to see them come back as zombies, in fact the only ones we do see 'zombified' are the ones pecked by the birds and the one girl who gets her legs bitten off. other than that, i was at least expecting the couple who were killed in the kitchen andor the guy who was killed on the bridge to come back as zombies. it is also amazing that these zombies only take a 'few bites' and then move on to their next victim. the most laughable moment was of course the zombie fetus. a pregnant woman who has been infected lies on a bed in a hospital. a woman who seems to have a lot of 'medical knowledge' tries to deliver the baby () and has her face pulled off by a zombie, before having her head pushed into the woman's stomach where a hand bursts out and proceeds to rip the rest of her face off. timelessas usual, all the characters are perfect stereotypes of this genre. the megalomaniacal military officer, the pathetic useless squealing women who scream to get killed, the obvious characters who are about to get killed (ie. watch for the man chasing a chicken) i guess this movie really is a comedy. there were many laughable scenes, such as the shed that gets blown up with a hand grenade (obviously the scene where the entire budget was spent) and a climatic scene where a man screams, i'm thirsty.... thirsty for your blood. the costumes are really bad  the same zombies reappear throughout the course of the film, wearing the same 'asianlike' clothing that may be found in a bruce lee film, and watch out for the blue 60's skirt the girl at the motel is wearing when she and her boyfriend bump into the infected man.the end of the film leaves open the door as usual for the apocalyptic storyline. a radio dj who narrates throughout the whole movie turns out to be a zombie himself and warns his listeners about the 'beginning of the end' while the two survivors take off in a helicopter. hardly dawn of the dead material if you ask me.regardless, this movie does deliver many laughs. the gore is minimal, and what gore there is, it is very unconvincing, let alone unimaginative. the usual mix of black blood, thick green goo oozing out of weeping sores and 'zombie makeup' consisting of green moss. zombi 3 makes for a good rental for a sleepover party or a night of beer and popcorn. other than that, horror fans should stay away.3 out of 10\",\n",

       " \"washington square is a flat, shabby adaptation of the short novel by henry james. indeed, the novel is very good, but far from the level of james' masterpieces. moreover its simple, eventless story seems unsuited to make it into a film (although william wyler, with his the heiress, gave in 1949 a beautiful version of the novel). anyway, the movie completely betrays the spirit of this work of the great american writer. in the novel, the heroine catherine is shy, not very attractive and somewhat clumsy, but nonetheless she is a sound, intelligent young woman, and she's not as naive as it may seem. her attachment for her father is dignified and respectful, with no morbid sides in it. along three quarters of the movie, catherine (jennifer jason leigh) just seems to be mentally retarded, poor thing. in the last quarter, she suddenly (and incredibly) becomes intelligent, aware of her dignity as a woman, and all that.the director agnieszka holland has added two vulgar scenes to the story. the first, when the nervous child catherine has, well, troubles with her vesica. the second scene, when we see on the background a sort of openair brothel, with prostitutes taking their customers behind tents, and so on. nothing could be more contrary to the spirit and artistic ideals of henry james. it is notorious that the writer was extremely decent and demure even for the standards of the victorian age. i defy anyone to find any coarseness anywhere in the thousands of pages of james' huge literary production. i really was particularly annoyed by these two scenes.yes, i know that a director needs reasonable freedom in the screen adaptation of a novel. but if a director utterly ignores or misunderstands the art of an author (here henry james), i don't see the point of using his work to make a bad movie. the acting is adequate to the movie: poor and flat, in spite of the talent of albert finney and maggie smith. washington square is definitely a nonrecommendable film.\",\n",

       " \"no movie with madeleine carroll in its cast could possibly be unwatchable. that said, i have to add that this british film comes close. the story takes place on board the `ss atlantic' and it's loosely based on the `titanic's' unfinished voyage. the word `unsinkable' is spoken, the liner strikes an iceberg, and we hear a heavenly choir sing `nearer my god to thee.' the doomed passengers eventually take over the anthem, in a clever bit of sound work. but the year of the film's release (1929) means that a modern viewer has to accept otherwise primitive sound and many of the acting conventions of silent films and the stage. these aren't problems. the film's major flaw is pacing, and pacing had been well developed in silents. however, if the dialog were delivered at a realistic speed, the movie's running time would be cut in half. the intended effect was drama (and clarity in a new medium), but the result unhappily is tiresome now. the film's structure is preposterously illogical and inept. paradoxically, i found certain details of the editing quite modern in technique: fine, abrupt cuts from one area of the ship to another, sometimes even on sound effects. although we're on board the `atlantic' from the first shot, we were well over 4 minutes into the movie before i discovered that fact. there are long, intrusive musical passages by the ship's dance orchestra. (entertaining, easy sound.) personal stories are presented in an utterly uninvolving and unconvincing way. don't even think of spectacle. the berg is a tiny thing and the exterior damage it does to the ship's hull is a minor dent. however, the scenes of passengers swarming into the lifeboats  clearly staged on a real liner, presumably tied up to a dock  generate great excitement. other than the glorious miss carroll, these sequences are the film's only points of excellence. as the movie and the ship near their end, the screen goes totally black several times when the power generators begin to fail. their last, eternal blackout is the end of the film, with a sunsetsunrise tacked on, a clumsy symbolic effect. `atlantic' is a cinema curiosity. at best.\",\n",

       " \"canadian director vincenzo natali took the arthouse circuit by storm with the intriguing and astonishingly intelligent cube, which is my personal favourite sf film of the 90s. it framed the basic conceit of a group of strangers trapped in a maze shaped like a giant cube, shot entirely on one set, and took this idea in fascinating directions. i've been eagerly awaiting natali's followup, and although its taken five years for him to mount another project, i'm delighted to say it was worth the wait. cypher is a fascinating exploration of one man's place in the world, and how through a completely logical chain of events, finds himself in a situation beyond his control.i don't want to reveal too much about the plot, because one of the joys of cypher is the different avenues it takes us down. it is so refreshing in this day and age to see a sf film that has more than one idea in it's head. cypher is such a film.morgan sullivan (jeremy northam), one of the blandest people to ever walk the planet, is hired by the company digicorp. they send him to different parts of america to record different seminars. to his bewilderment, they are unbelievably boring. covering topics as mundane as shaving cream and cheese.while morgan is waiting for one seminar, he runs into rita foster (an impeccably cast lucy liu), the definition of an ice maiden. she gives him the brushoff, but there is something to her he finds irresistible. that's not too surprising considering the dry marriage he is in. when rita turns up at another one of morgan's seminars, she tells him his life is not what it appears. and i'm not saying anything more about the plot. to do so would cheapen the impact the rest of the film has on us, as well as the tortuous path that's so much fun to follow.as with cube, natali shows quite a talent for encompassing seemingly ordinary people, taking them out of the familiar, and basically seeing what will happen when they're thrust into the unknown. and cypher follows similar patterns. but it's not a carbon copy of cube. it has it's own inspiration.cypher is a film that has more in common with conspiracy thrillers and paranoia stories. one of the great things about cypher is the way these themes creep into the story without your knowledge. when morgan realises his false identity is a piece of a much larger puzzle, it's as much of a shock to us as it is to him.one thing that distinguishes cypher from cube is how much more polished it is. where cube was confined to a minimalist setting and a shoestring budget with a cast of unknowns, cypher is also on a low budget, but natali economises it as much as he can, allowing him to broaden the horizon, and launching morgan on an amazing journey through the labyrinth of his own identity.natali's direction is exceptional, with a deft hand on the reins. there are some amazing camera angles from above, such as the enormity of the digicorp building as a vast, robust office block in conjunction to the insignificant speck that is morgan standing outside. all the colour appears to have been bled out of the picture, which compliments the tone of the film perfectly as a modern day filmnoir.the acting is uniformly excellent throughout. jeremy northam is a sympathetic figure from his loveless marriage to questioning his own identity. his performance is excellent because it's so modulated. he literally seems to transform right before our very eyes. from a clinical, spineless wimp to a confident man who will do anything to preserve his new identity.david hewlett puts in a welcome appearance who made such an impact in cube. he resides in a secret silo that looks like it was borrowed from men in black. his scene is one of the best because it's an exercise in carefully calculated suspense and paranoia. he is a supposed expert in identifying doubleagents, and it's a fantastic piece of writing, brilliantly acted by hewlett. all he has to do is look at morgan, and we're drawn into his complex mind game.but it's lucy liu who's the scene stealer here. too often she is cast in films where her potential is not utilised to full effect. but in cypher, she is finally given a character that fits her like a glove. rita is an aloof, guarded femme fatale that liu inhabits with relish. i perked up every time she appeared because she is always in control, and can reduce a room to silence by the power of her icy stare alone.things come to a very gratifying end, that doesn't conclude on an ambiguous note the way cube did. but morgan deserves his happy ending. after he's been put through the ringer like this, i cheered for him in the final scene. it's a perfect final moment because it comes as a ray of sunshine after a gloomy 90 minutes.cypher succeeds on all counts. engaging, shocking, always entertaining, it's everything that total recall wanted to be but wasn't. and it comes as a refreshing antidote to the overwhelming and inexplicable matrix.a fine followup from natali. and now i'm a committed fan of the man. superb stuff\",\n",

       " \"... for paris is a moveable feast. ernest hemingwayit is impossible to count how many great talents have immortalized paris in paintings, novels, songs, poems, short but unforgettable quotes, and yes  movies. the celebrated film director max ophüls said about paris, it offered the shining wet boulevards under the street lights, breakfast in montmartre with cognac in your glass, coffee and lukewarm brioche, gigolos and prostitutes at night. everyone in the world has two fatherlands: his own and paris. paris is always associated with love and romance, and paris, je t'aime which is subtitled petite romances, is a collection of short films, often sketches from 18 talented directors from all over the world. in each, we become familiar with one of the city of light 20 arrondissements and with the parisians of all ages, genders, colors, and backgrounds who all deal in love in its many variations and stages. in some of the petite romances we are the witnesses of the unexpected encounters of the strangers that lead to instant interest, closeness, and perhaps relationship: like for podalydès and florence muller in the street of montmartre in the opening film or for cyril descours and leïla bekhti as a white boy and a muslim girl whose crosscultural romance directed by gurinder chadha begins on quais de seine. i would include into this category the humorous short film by gus van sant. in le marais one boy pours his heart out to another boy confessing of sudden unexpected closeness, asking permission to call  never realizing that the object of his interest does not understand french.some of the vignettes are poignant and even dark. in walter salles and daniela thomas' loin du 16ème, catalina sandino mareno (amazing oscar nominated debut for maria full of grace) is single, workingclass mother who has to work as a nanny in a wealthy neighborhood to pay for daycare where she drops her baby every morning before she goes to work. one of most memorable and truly heartbreaking films is place des fêtes by oliver schmitz. aïssa maïga and seydou boro costar as two young people for who love could have happened. there were the promises of it but it was cut short due to hatred and intolerance that are present everywhere, and the city of love and light is no exception. another one that really got to me was bastille, written and directed by isabel coixet, starring sergio castellitto, miranda richardson, and leonor watling. castellitto has fallen out of love with his wife, richardson but when he is ready to leave with the beautiful mistress, the devastating news from his wife's doctor arrives...i can go on reflecting on all 18 small gems. i like some of them very much. the others felt weak and perhaps will be forgotten soon but overall, i am very glad that i bought the dvd and i know that i will return to my favorite films again and again. they are place des fêtes that i've mentioned already, pèrelachaise directed by wes craven that involves the ghost of one of the wittiest and cleverest men ever, oscar wilde (alexander payne, the director of sideways) who would save one troubled relationship. payne also directed 14th arrondissement in which a lonely middleaged postworker from denver, co explores the city on her own providing the voice over in french with the heavy accent. payne's entry is one of the most moving and along with hilarious tuileries by joel and ethan coen with (who else :)) steve buschemi is my absolute favorite. in both shorts, american tourists sit on the benches (margo in the park, and steve in paris metro after visiting louvers) observing the life around them with the different results. while margo may say, my feeling's sad and light; my sorrow is bright... steve's character will find out that sometimes, even the most comprehensive and useful tourist guide would not help a tourist avoiding doing the wrong things in a foreign country.\",\n",

       " \"ecstasy (1933) (usa 1940) starring hedy lamarr (as hedy kiesler)the world's first glimpse of a 19 yearold hedy lamarr occurs in the early moments of this 1930's treasure as she sweeps across the screen in an angelic wedding gown. this was to be the start of a legendary career. this was our glorious introduction to the most beautiful woman ever to grace the silver screen.it is eva's (lamarr) wedding night and her older husband seems uninterested in her romantic advances. she retreats to the lonely bed and, in a beautiful scene, she fiddles with her wedding ring as the realization of her marital mistake overcomes her. the husband seems more interested in neatness and order than he does in love. gustav machaty uses gorgeous camera angles and pristine shot framing to capture lamarr's considerable talent and beauty. with no words spoken in the early part of the film, she is able to grasp our sympathy, our hearts and our support. it is that combination that prepared the 1930's audiences for what they were about to see as the film unfolded. 'ecstasy' was considered shocking for its time... some thought it to be scandalous.she returns home to her father's estate and files for divorce. the next day, she wakes with a complete sense of freedom and happiness. she just has to go outside and feel the freedom of the countryside and fresh air. eva goes for a horseback ride and happens across a beautiful lake. and in one of the most famous scenes in film history, hedy lamarr became the first person to ever appear nude in a major film. her frolic in the woods and her skinnydipping adventure in the lake were legendarily scandalous. but the audiences couldn't stay away. as with many of today's movies, the controversy made it a mustsee film.eva's mischievous adventure introduces her to a handsome young man who helps her find her horse, who had run off with her clothes. after an awkward meeting, they eventually fall for each other. their first romantic rendezvous was almost as controversial as the nude scene, with its blatant waves of eroticism. however, machaty does beautiful work in these romantic moments. machaty creates one delightful moment, when eva literally seems to sink into her new lover, using a gorgeous early camera trick.it cannot be overstated how brave this performance was on lamarr's part. many might have presumed it was career suicide. instead, it gained her worldwide fame and caught the eye louis b mayer, who signed her to a contract with mgm. there are some truly erotic moments in this film, even by today's raunchy standards. it is impossible to imagine how they were received in the 1930's. again, machaty was very clever with his imagery, leaving a lot to the imagination. but we all understand very well what we are seeing and it is supremely well done.the meeting of eva's former husband and her current lover is perhaps inevitable. however, the consequences of that meeting are not. the film takes a few unexpected turns in its final act and it all makes for a great story and a lovely debut on the grand stage of movie stardom for hedy lamarr.i highly recommend this once controversial, now tame film and urge you to seek it out in its restored form on dvd. it is easily worthwhile, if only for the pleasure of seeing hedy lamarr. but the story is compelling too and the direction is ahead of its time.

       " \"twisted, bizarre, enchanting, and hilarious i couldn't stop laughing watching this film. darren stein presents the movies he made on the family camcorder growing up in southern california in the 1980's. it's an interesting look at a budding filmmaker and his motivations and ability to manipulate for the camera. manipulation is a strong word, however don't we all watch movies to be manipulated in some way or another from the beginning, i was amused at the fact that the boys in the films seemed to appear shirtless whenever possible. later, darren comments about his budding homosexuality, and you can see it from the hints (big hints) of flamboyance at an early age. maybe it was just the warm southern california weather, who knows as a gay man who also grew up in a nurturing environment, it's great to see that his parents supported and loved him, and that his friends seemed to be entranced with his nascent talent behind the lens.put the camera on me offers a look back to the 80's untouched by commercialism. you'll remember the hair, the music, and the fashions. i'm the same age as mr. stein, so the trip back to memory lane was welcome. his solo lipsyncing dance number is priceless, enhanced by the frankie goes to hollywood tshirt.the films deal with dark themes at time. child abuse, the holocaust, nuclear war, sexual fantasy, and social dysfunction. no childhood is completely carefree, and the way stein deals with these subjects is interesting to say the least, and hilarious to behold.watch at your earliest convenience\",\n",
       " \"perspective is a good thing. since the release of star wars episode i: the phantom menace, claims and counterclaims of just how episode's ii and iii will eventuate has taken the spotlight off the 'original' star wars films, making them part of a cohesive whole, rather than segregating the older and new films into separate trilogies. what the new films have done is allow fresh perspectives to be placed on the older films. this new outlook allows us to greater appreciate what has often been viewed as the weakest of the original trilogy: return of the jedi. often derided for its overly 'cute' factor, rotj is in a sense as strong as the original and only slightly less impressive than the nearly perfect the empire strikes back. indeed the 'cute' element of rotj, namely the ewoks, remains a weak link in the entire series. did george lucas place the furry midgets in the film purely for the merchandising possibilities only he can answer that question.this cute factor aside, the film is a brilliant full circle and evolution of the saga. following on from the conclusion of the empire strikes back, luke skywalker (mark hamill) follows his rebel alliance friends to tatooine, his home planet, to rescue han solo (harrison ford), the space pirate turned rebel hero who was captured by jabba the hutt for overdue debts.skywalker is a changed man since leaving tatooine with ben 'obi wan' kenobi (alec guiness) to fight the evil empire. now swathed all in black, luke's discovery of his origins have left him confused and torn. his psychological make up is not as strong as his outward appearance would suggest. while he might aim to always assist his rebel friends, he yearns for another chance to confront the evil darth vader again, despite his unassuredness as to whether he will destroy him or eventually turn to the dark side and join vader at the emperor's side.early scenes in tatooine are impressive, from jabba's lair, to his floating palace and the 'almighty sarlac'  an intenstine that lives in the sand. lucas' cgi enhancements to the film in 1997 actually worsened the overall effect of the sarlac, making it look fake and overdone.the battle scene on tatooine is outstanding, and is one of the more memorable of the saga. luke almost singlehandedly anihiliates jabba and his cronies, proving his prowess as a jedi is now almost complete.when luke returns to the degobah system to visit the ailing yoda one more time, the viewer is let down by yoda's distinct lack of screentime. undoubtably the star of the empire strikes back, yoda is all but erased from the story as the progression of luke's destiny is played out on screen.rotj really is luke's film, perhaps even more so than the original. his journey carries the movie as he moves closer to his confrontation with darth vader and his fate. the other rebel characters certainly work in his shadow. the romance between leia (carrie fisher) and solo is all but nonexistant, unlike in empire. in fact only leia's character is developed in rotj, solo's character seems to fade as the facets of his personality have become too familiar in the first two films.their roles are consigned to working alongside the rebels to destroy an all new death star that nears completion. this time the emperor himself is overseeing the final stages of construction. the empire intends to crush the rebellion once and for all, while the emperor himself schemes to bring the now powerful skywalker to his side to work alongside (or is that replace) darth vader. the emperor is a different kind of evil for this film, less cunning than governor tarkin (peter cushing) from star wars, more deeply psychologically dark than anything else. played brilliantly by ian mcdiarmid, the emperor is just one of those characters you love to hate.all the other actors are well entrenched in their roles. hamill surprises as the more wisened luke, making his character's progression from whiny teenager, impatient student to enlightened warrior one of the few real character developments of the series. ford's role is waring thin, as all his charm and charisma was spent in the first two films  he was the real star of the first film after all. fisher's leia is more of a prop, at least unti the end of the film where she learns things about herself that she was never sure about... add in favourites like alec guiness as kenobi, yoda and the loveable chewbacca, c3po and r2d2 and the series resembles a family more than a cast.despite the film's corny forest battle involving the ewoks and the empire, it ends well and includes a three way battle sequence: on endor, in space and on the death star, each with very impressive special effects. the music, as always, is brilliant and captures the mood perfectly in every instance. just as the 'blue danube' worked perfectly for 2001: a space odyssey, john williams' score is as much a part of star wars folklore as light sabers and the force.lucas left the ending open to interpretation, meaning there could have been more episodes made. indeed scifi fans have created their own versions of episodes vii, viii and ix in their heads over and over again. rotj works when given a chance, and furry cute animals aside is a good finish to the series.when all six episodes get to be viewed together, this saga could well be the best ever made. is it already the addition of episode i changed the landscape of the series. this is why return of the jedi can now be viewed in a different light and be given a whole new appreciation nearly 20 years after its release.\",\n",

       " \"saying this movie is extremely hard to follow and just as frustrating to sit through is putting it very mildly. also saying that the current available print is dark, dreary, scratchy, abysmally edited, painfully dubbed, seemingly censored and in almost unwatchable shape is also correct. this film is in dire need of a good remastering from the full, uncut, original negative and seeing how it's reasonably atmospheric (and won the director an award at the catalonia film festival), it might actually be worth the trouble. then again, maybe not... it's just impossible to tell in its current condition what kind of movie it actually is. it starts fairly interesting, if you can discount the completely senseless precredits opening sequence, which involves a deranged catkilling, snakeloving little girl named gerda. the girls mom, carla (mónica randall, who should have laid off the eyeliner a little bit), splashes some gasoline around in the garage and torches the brat. seemingly about as crazy as young gerda, she goes to visit her estranged photographer (ex) boyfriend mario (johncihangir caffari). he's on vacation from work, but so desperate to get away from carla that he begs his employers to set him up on an assignment... any assignment. she scowls you'll be sorry as he heads out the door. well, mario is assigned to photograph witches mountain (somewhere in the pyrenees, i believe). before he gets to his destination, he gets sight of a hottie on the beach named delia (patty shepard) and snaps a few pictures of her taking off her bikini top. only slightly peeved, she claims to be a single writer, the two flirt and then decide it would be a swell idea if they went on the trip up the mountain together. when they stop by her place so she can pack her bags, mario suddenly hears loud, sinister music. delia claims he's just hearing things.so the two begin their trip up the mountain, taking a stop at a local inn to spend the night. there they encounter a weird, partiallydeaf, crazyeyed innkeeper (victor israel) and delia claims someone was spying on here through her window. the next day, under some trance, she wanders off up the mountain and is eventually located by mario, who hops out of his jeep and runs after her. while he's finding out what's up, someone steals their wheels and they're forced to walk a piece, eventually finding the jeep undamaged at the foot of a small, ancient, seeming abandoned village... almost like someone was trying to intentionally lure them there. well as we will see, that's exactly what has happened. in the village they encounter a friendly old woman named zanta (ana farra) who claims she's the only person still living there and lets them stay in her home. mario takes some pictures of the abandoned city and when he develops them they are eerily full of people. slightly creeped out, he and delia begin to leave and get stuck in treacherous fog and have to pull over and camp out for the night. the rest of the movie has to do with voodoo dolls, black cats transforming into sexy women, satanic rituals performed by ladies in their bras and a deadly fall off a cliff. and yeah, coincidentally carla the estranged wife turns out to be one of the witches, too. it all takes place in semidarkness and to be quite honest, i didn't know what the hell was going on most of the time. the inconclusive open ending is just an additional slap in the face to anyone having to suffer through the rest of this senseless mess.honestly, there are just a few things that stand out to me as being really good. the first is actress shepard, who has that great barbara steele kind of dark, mysterious beauty. there's also an excellent music score (credited to fernando garcia morcillo) and chanting songs, which aided immensely in making this film as atmospheric as it is. the location work is fairly decent, but as i said, the print is ugly as can be and it doesn't make a lick of sense, so proceed with caution on this one.\",\n",

       " \"one of the most appealing elements of a gilliam film is that the wellconcocted visuals, the unsettling backdrops, and the manically frustrated characters are evidence of the creator's involvement. instead of most movies (where the filmmaker is some directorforhire that is paid to feature a star or two), you can feel terry gilliam's presence through the experience. 12 monkeys is evidence of gilliam's own vision and style, as opposed to making offbeat movies for their own sake. 12 monkeys is a variation on similar themes of gilliam's repertoire:oppressiverecessive societies, the solitude of the protagonist, the frustration associated with disbelief, and parallel realms. in this film gilliam does a fine job of blurring lines between the two realms, using ambiguities to force the audience to believe rather than know. this tendency for gilliam to neglect to fill in certain gaps leads to criticisms of arthouse pretentiousness. the difference between gilliam and artsy posers is that gilliam's choices clearly have a purpose and all of his images have meaning. the two nearly identical bathing scenes of cole in the beginning are meant to draw comparisons which leave the audience unsettled. his bald head is a mark of uniformity in the diseaseridden future world, yet makes him recognizable in the 1996 world. the title itself is a mark of gilliam's creativity, as it requires the majority of the story to flesh out for its meaning to be fully understood. all in all, gilliam's dedication to making creative films that are interesting to watch yet also require thought and interpretation from the audience. the film has immense rewatch value, since there are subtle details and hints that can be missed upon the first viewing. definitely one of my favorites.\",\n",

picture one the most liked films even to this very day that i have ever seen was of the heroism,bravery and the honor to have served in her majestys service.this film is not always what it seems and that is perhaps as it should be,however i cant say enough for the courage exhibited by sgt.cutter in defense of the uniform that he too would of sacrificed his life to save from peril of the sort that they and the troop were threatened with the emergence of this thugee group.to be certain sgt. cutter is the kind of individual you might suggest something about and then you watch this unequivocal belief not only in each other but in her majesty the queen of england.i think for all of his lust for money and the such that that character was great.a reckless brave courageous soldier who did not know fear.i think grant was excellent in this role,truly a very capable rendering made compelling by the uniform that he wore.i never felt ballantine was a shoein ,in fact there was so much confidence in there assumptions that you might be well not to look to close because it is still only a picture.what do i meanthis picture is still only a motion picture and like the times in which these events take place as well as when the picture was actually made provide a look at how things were done then and what or why there are so many different opinions as to this motion picture will distract your attention.both ballantine and machesney are equal in there dedication with both men from time to time providing a unflinching daring as to there jobs as men in the service of her majesty.these three seem to bring things off rather well and i believe it is a useful,even enjoyable interlude when ballantine has a date with destiny or so it would seem only to have fate as you would have it intervene.is it believablei don't know.i think it is very fitting when the company having escaped the clutches of death in tantrapur and they are dragging there tails as they are approaching the main gates to the regiments post when ballantine allows the other two to know that he is leaving the service,and getting married and going into the tea business.machesney says he could sign up for another 9 years.it will make a man out of him.i like that sentiment.i don't think there is any doubt as to just what it means to have brave dependable courageous soldiers representing your very best interests.where does this end,in fact it may never end.those interests are so well placed as to what is important in this world that i enjoy this picture today as much as perhaps i enjoyed the picture when i was ten years old.i had never known about the truthfulness of this film up to recently when i went into history and found the information about kali.there is quite a good deal to learn however once all is said and done about the historical significance of the goddess of kali,this motion picture takes on a quality that i refer to as intelligence.this is a very honest attempt to convey a belief in what is being attempted.i think this is an excellent film.george stevens directed.there is a few items to be aware of i don't think all the information will jive with history however when the journalist is addressed as mr.kipling things can get very emotional because all the rest are characters but this is rudyard kiplinggeorge stevens went over the top to convey a time and a time before when these events actually occurred.the information is honest,compelling and it will not only draw you in but you will need to understand about why we so love gunga din.there is in the distance the black watch is out in front and they are approaching a most certain peril and possible defeat unless the troop can be warned.sgt.cutter is seriously wounded and ballantine as well as machesney are restrained.din having a deep wound at the base of his back as the result of a bayonet thrust deeply into his body from behind is up to the demand of having to warn the colonel of impending peril.with a effort worthy of our most sincerest desires in this life time din slowly climbs and manages to scale the steeple which rests as the top of the tuggee temple.the sound of gunga dins horn allows the approaching army to be forewarned.a very large scale battle ensues and the enemy is nullified.it is so dramatic and tense filled position that as gunga din lay dead on a pile of rocks which his bullet riddled body now shows,sgt.cutter says good work soldier.i don't know of any more dramatic moment nor one where we learn what sacrifice means then when the troop is forewarned of the impending peril.the end is far from being anticlimatic,it is the telling of who gunga din is and what he means now to the honored men in uniform for whom he willing sacrificed.ballantine knows his heart and asks the colonel to take care of his enlistment papers and this makes machesney quite pleased with the colonel being honest places the enlistment papers in his pocket to be dealt with at perhaps at a more appropriate time.the colonel says at the place where now all are gathered that we have all done enough soldiering for one long day and further comments on how pleased there efforts were in defense.machesney says he would rather here that from the colonel than get a bloomin medal.this is a very sober point and then he comes to din.now here is a man who has no actually status so i am going to appoint him a corporal and his name shall be written on the rolls of our honored dead.the poem is read as though it was just penned by kipling himself who stands by the gravesite with the

       " \"ying, a chinese girl who speaks czech, invited us to screening of a czech movie (with english subtitles) in the department of visual and environmental studies (ves). it was the first time i saw samotá&#345;i (loners, 2000) and it was pretty good.much like in many other czech movies, the seven central characters seem to have a pretty difficult, dirty life; the web indicates that this theme was popular among the u.s. movies in the early 1990s. their relationships are breaking up, combining, and recombining. another typical feature of the czech movies is that neither of the characters is designed to be a universally negative one and neither of them is a permanently positive character either. also, you can see how the characters judge the features of others depending on the context; that's a very realistic feature of the movie's psychological analysis.ond&#345;ej is a talented and married young surgeon who has two daughters. nevertheless, you learn that he has only studied neurobiology to prove how much he loved another woman, hanka. he is so obsessed that he repeatedly dresses up as a plumber to get into hanka's parents' house  a house that he repeatedly burns.meanwhile, hanka has a very mixed relationship with her parents. she just decides  by tossing up a coin  to break up with petr who works in a private radio station. hanka does not view her parents' bourgeois life as a good example but seems rather unsuccessful in creating a better environment. but she is a very flexible figure, as far as the type of her boyfriends go.for a while, hanka seems to have serious plans with jakub, an innocent drug addict whose memory seems to be rather devastated by the drugs. however, the friends from his band inform jakub that he already has another girlfriend. hanka is disappointed and returns to her parents.when hanka and petr break up, it is organized by robert, a matchmaker who also works for a travel agency where his job is to show the life of ordinary czech people to japanese tourists. robert  who also provides jakub with marijuana  is never serious about anything and he usually sleeps with many different women; eventually, his mother dies in a hospital and he has his own ways to deal with the depression.vesna (a slavic word for spring) who came to prague from macedonia works as a barmaid  and you won't learn whether she came to czechia in order to see her dad or ufos. she seems pretty confused but sometimes helps the other characters from their problems.petr works in the radio station and he is the only one who likes his job  a job that he eventually loses. he announces to his audience that he broke up with hanka  which is how ond&#345;ej learns about the news that make him very happy.finally, ond&#345;ej's wife lenka is always ready to forgive him and stabilize their marriage  even after ond&#345;ej asks a magician to make him disappear so that ond&#345;ej can try to capture hanka again. (the magician pays his debt because he is a brother of a victim of an important car accident  jakub and hanka bring the victim to the hospital and ond&#345;ej saves his life.) lenka also works for the travel agency  as a translator  and eventually she has to translate some hysterical scenes for 20 or so japanese tourists who are shooting their movies during hanka parents' dinner.the seven characters interact in interesting and exciting ways that would be natural if prague were smaller by four orders of magnitude. given the actual size of the czech capital, it looks a bit unlikely that all these events would take place among seven people, but it is fun.\",\n",

(i wonder if they watch this on wedding anniversaries.......big bad love should be the next stop for anyone who has not seen it; it's brilliant.) and, dennis quaid in full clown makeup, sneakily introduced, angled, hidden and displayed by the shot selection and full bloomed delivery is of the kind of pure dark movie magic you don't see very often. quaid has always had a sinister quality to him for me anyways, with that huge slit mouth span, hiding behind his flicker eyes lying in wait to unleash itself as either mischievous charm or diabolical weirdness (here as both). both howard and quaid have the insane fire behind the eyes to pull off their wonderful intense internal gunslinger squareoffs in darkly cool fashion. in fact the whole film has a darkly cool energy and hip intensity. it's really a fantastic film, put together by intelligence, imagination, agility and chemistry by all parties involved. i really cannot imagine how this got funded, and it looks pretty expensive to me, by such a conventional, imaginationless system, but i thank god films like this slip through the system every once in awhile. in a great way, with all of its dayglo bright carnival colors, hip intelligence, darkly warped truthful humor and enthralling chemistry it reminds me of one of my favorite films of all time: grosse pointe blank.......now that's a compliment in my book\",\n",

       " \"'renaissance (2006)' was created over a period of six years, cofunded by france, luxembourg and the united kingdom at a cost of around \\x8014 million. the final result is a staggering accomplishment of comicbook style animation, aesthetically similar to what robert rodriguez and frank miller achieved with 'sin city (2005),' but this film employed motion capture with liveactors to translate their faces and movements into an entirely animated format. presented in stark blackandwhite, the film looks as though it has been hoisted from the very pages of the graphic novel on which it was based, and the futuristic city of paris looms ominously above us. directed by french filmmaker christian volckman, in his featurelength debut, 'renaissance' draws significantly from other films in the sciencefiction genre, and the technoir storyline isn't something we haven't seen before, but, from a technical standpoint, it is faultless.the year is 2054. the city of paris is a crumbling metropolis filled with dark alleys and deserted footpaths, the recent installation of modern technology merely offering a thin mask to the pitiable degradation of the darkened buildings. the city's largest corporation, avalon, achieved wealth through offering citizens the promise of beauty and youth, and the company's research department is continually striving to invent greater means of eliminating the aging process. ilona tasuiev (voiced by romola garai in the englishlanguage version, which i watched) , a brilliant young scientist, is mysteriously kidnapped on her return from work, and so it falls to legendary detective barthélémy karas (daniel craig) to uncover her current whereabouts. possibly holding the key to the woman's disappearance is bislane (catherine mccormack), ilona's hardened elder sister, whose trustworthiness is in question, and jonas muller (ian holm), the dedicated medical doctor who adored ilona as his own daughter.the eerie, dimlylit city of paris is reminiscent of ridley scott's 'blade runner (1982),' and some of the technology looks as though it might have been borrowed from tom cruise in 'minority report (2002)' {which was, coincidentally, also set in the year 2054}. however, despite this familiarity, volckman has created an exciting world for his characters to inhabit. blending classic filmnoir and sciencefiction, the result is an eyecatching collage of harsh lighting and dark shadows, which, i should warn, occasionally becomes difficult on the viewer's eyes. the dialogue is a little banal at times, and the story, though engaging, doesn't offer anything strikingly original {except for the ending, which i thought was a bold twist on the usual formula}, but 'renaissance' is intended to work best as a visual treat, and that it succeeds in this regard cannot be denied.\",\n",

       " \"one reason pixar has endured so well, and been so successful, is that while their films remain technical marvels and visual mosaics, they have a story to match their style. and often very moving style at that: affecting, charming and crossgenerational. that a lot anime (speaking in broad terms) and a great many other animations fail to match their technical virtuosity with real substance is, i think (and i might be wrong) partly because either the makers aren't bothered with character and plot and focus far too much on sound and image, or the sheer effort that goes into making some animations is so enormous, so enervating that they don't have the energy to create a really engaging story.that same cannot be said of renaissance. there are flaws in its plot, but i'll get to that later. those same flaws, however, are not reflected in the visuals  renaissance is nowt short of stunning. the ultrahigh contrast images (sometimes so highcontrast that is nothing but one face or one beam of light visible) and incredible detail are always impressive, always a joy to behold. the futuristic paris on display is the grim offspring of blade runner and brave new world; dark, murky, quite affluent and even clean, but shrouded in intrigue, corporate malfeasance, obsessed with beauty (capital of the catwalk, after all) and disguising the squalor and neglect of its labyrinthine passages with a veneer of monumental, sophisticated architecture.it's a compelling environment, not entirely original, but great all the same. the film's muchtouted 'motioncapture' technology and incredible attention to human and design minutiae result in images a blackandwhite photographer would die for. not that the detail prevents entertainment, because christian volckman crafts some superb action sequences: a hellforleather care chase, a couple of gruesome(ly imaginative) murders, several tussles in the dark and a nasty dustup in a gloomy apartment. the locations are great, too (i want to visit the nightclub). while the central character of karas is your regular offtheshelf maverick cop, the other two female characters (who are sisters) are the real motors of the movie. coming from wartorn eastern europe, products of a war, diaspora and a family spat, they're a compelling metaphor for europe as a whole.the film is tremendously atmospheric, its dizzying, swooping fauxcamera moves and adult tone making for a very engaging experience. however, the plot... it never becomes more interesting than the initial hook, in which indefatigable plod karas must find ilona tasuiev, a dropdead gorgeous and pioneering scientist, after she's snatched from the street. the sinister corporation avalon (is any corporation ever not sinister), which she was working for on 'classified', projects are hellbent on her retrieval, and soon karas is up to his neck in official reprimands, dead bodies, cigarettesmoke and narrowlymissed bullets, and falling in love with ilona's sister bislane (very sympathetically voiced by catherine mccormack), as he plumbs the depths of the city's sordid underbelly (and his own past).textbook noir, in other words, but while i enjoyed the film a lot more than sin city (to which it bears a passing visual resemblance), the plot and resolution are dull, the theme of immortality being raised but never examined, and the shenanigans of highrolling avalon ceo paul dellenbach are also dull , undercutting a lot of the dramatic tension. the basic ideas are familiar scifi genre materials, and there's a nagging sense that the visuals and atmosphere are disguising the mundane material.however, the film as a whole is lucid and perfectly coherent, even if some of the scenarios the characters get into occasionally feel like excuses for displays of technical wizardry. but it's the projection of life in paris circa 2054, the vision of community and creation of another city from the ground up that makes this film something to behold. i may be taking it too seriously, and if that's the case i can at least say that it's superbly made, extremely entertaining (and pretty mature, too), and with an ambiance like no other.\",\n",

       " \"film can be a looking glass to see the world in a new light. good night and good luck, for instance, offered parallels to modern judgementwithoutevidence and encroachments on freedom. it is easier to examine a moral problem when it is not too close to home: by putting it in a fictional or historic context removed from our immediate situation. with pornography, we consider ourselves 'enlightened' and our forefathers to be hidebound by quaint ideas  usually involving fire and brimstone, but the definition of what is obscene can easily fall prey to ignorance and unscientific interpretation instead of evidence. bettie page was a cult icon of an era which included not just mccarthyism but the banning of comics (such as tales from the crypt) on the basis that they would turn youths into halfmad juvenile delinquents. this film, developed from key questions raised in her life, poses dilemmas that are as relevant today as back in 1950.our film opens with two key scenes. in the first, we see welldressed, respectable looking men in a seedy bookshop. one of them asks for pictures of women in kinky boots and being restrained  then turns out to be an undercover cop conducting a sting. the second scene shows bettie page, waiting to be called as a witness, looking quite demure, as if she had just come out of church.the first 50mins are in black & white. old fashioned film effects such as wipes and fades add to the sense that we are watching a film from bygone years, as do the mannerisms of the cast, skilfully recreated 1950s scenes, contemporaneous slang phrases and the terse dialogue associated with filmmaking of the period. archive footage is frequently intercut  which will delight many and irritate others. in keeping with its theme, the movie is almost a collection of different types of photographyinmotion, and the older clips of fabulous beaches and landmarks juxtapose well against bettie's classic poses hearken back to an age of 'health & nature' magazines . . . although i admit that if you are not captivated by the story you may find the effect a bit choppy.very soon, we go into flashback. bettie escapes a depression years downtrodden life in nashville, enlivened only with church singing and soulsaving, and goes alone to make her own way. after her initial success, her modelling work splits into two strands: the mainstream glamour work focussing on her overtherainbow smile, and the 'specialist interest' photos involving dressing up in highheeled boots and light bondage gear. in an earlier audition (reminiscent of a scene with naomi watts' character in mulholland drive  who was also called betty), she gives a performance that is full of emotion, contrasting with her normal animated, cheerful (but ultimately bland) daytoday expression. is part of her still unfulfilled bettie is frequently rejected in auditions once they realise she is the wellknown pinup girl. but we have never been asked to feel sorry for bettie page: her abusive childhood is quickly referenced and skipped over; when she is raped by four hometown lads, we see only the threat and then bettie recovering and surviving, picking herself up in deserted woodland, and putting on the brave face of someone who refuses to lie down and die.although no nudity is involved, it's bettie's special interest photos that eventually arouse trouble. when we go back to the court, the opinions of a clergyman on the corrupting influence of such photos are taken as evidence. a psychologist authoritatively says how the photos lead to 'suicide, murder and psychosis' in youngsters who are exposed to them (presumably not in that order). eventually a star witness explains how his son's life came to an end as a result of such photos  'being 'trussed up like that'. it is not made clear how being 'trussed up' causes death). the text accompanying a series of bettie's photographs in a magazine tell how she was forced to endure 'terrible agonies' with the fetish restraints (the audience knows that she actually found them quite hilarious and that the wordings, like the photos themselves, were pure dramatisations). after a 12hr wait, bettie is told her evidence  she is the one person who could state definitively that she was not photographed in agony  will 'not be required'. the 'horrors' of the photos have been proved.if this all sounds like the dark ages which we have left, consider a recent (2003) incident in which an ann summers advert was banned. it said, for fashion and passion whip along to your local store, with a photograph of a woman's back. she's wearing a bra and thong and her hands are handcuffed behind her back. the lingerie and sex toys company, that targets female consumers (and also supports charities fighting domestic violence) said its adverts aimed, to give women sexual confidence and always showed women in control of their sexuality. one might conclude that the prejudice and ignorance of the betty page investigations still holds currency.bettie's religious views are integral to the story, just as the concept of sin is integral to christianity and contributes to the 'forbidden' nature of sexual enjoyment frequently prevalent in the uk and us  as opposed to the more factual approach found in continental europe. it could be argued the formulae of sin and redemption, and being saved, are even reflected in mating patterns that perpetuate traditional male dominance. a policeman making a friendly (but sexually motivated) approach to bettie outside the courtroom offers to 'save' her from loneliness. the knightinshiningarmour might be chivalrous, but it also assumes a woman in need of rescue.love it or hate it, the notorious bettie page is an unusual and extraordinary film, and a moral wakeup call for those that heed it. there is excellent ensemble acting, and gretchen mol, as bettie, is remarkable as the whole film succeeds or falls on her powerful performance.\",\n",

       " \"new york police detective mark dixon (dana andrews) is a guy who has to deal with his own demons on a daily basis at the same time as coping with the normal ups and downs of everyday life. the strain produced by his internal struggle and his intense hatred of criminals, leads him to make serious errors of judgement and to fail to recognise the need for any code of conduct to be adhered to in his dealings with people on the wrong side of the law. he has a track record of treating suspects and known criminals with gross brutality and this has brought him into conflict with his superior officers who have censured him for the amount of violence he has regularly used. dixon cannot reconcile these calls for restraint with his own extreme and irrational hatred of all criminals. he is tormented by the fact that his father was a criminal and has been left with a powerful need to live down his father's reputation and to avoid fulfilling the low expectations that many people have of him as a consequence.when a rich texan is murdered following an evening's gambling run by gangster tommy scalise (gary merrill), dixon is assigned to the case. scalise tells dixon's superior officer detective lieutenant thomas (karl malden) that the victim had been accompanied by ken paine (craig stevens) and his wife morgan (gene tierney) and that paine had committed the murder. dixon goes to paine's apartment and questions the suspect who is both inebriated and uncooperative and when paine punches him, dixon retaliates and paine collapses and dies. dixon goes on to dispose of the body in a nearby river. paine's wife is questioned and after describing what had happened at scalise's place, adds that her father had gone to paine's apartment later that night to take issue with him about the fact that she'd returned home with facial bruising. paine had previously attacked her on a number of occasions and her father, jiggs taylor (tom tully), had threatened that if it happened again he would beat paine up. this information leads to taylor being arrested and charged with murder. nobody accepts dixon's explanation that scalise had killed the texan and then had paine killed to eliminate him as a witness.dixon continues to make various attempts to get scalise convicted but eventually realises that the only way to successfully achieve his goal is to write a confession about his own role in paine's death and the cover up. he does this and also records that he is going alone to confront scalise so that the police can arrest the gangster for dixon's murder. the confrontation with scalise and the eventual means by which dixon achieves his own redemption, provide a tense and fitting conclusion to this gritty thriller.dana andrews' strained and preoccupied expressions convey his character's perpetually troubled nature and his anxieties as he deals with a series of misfortunes which include and follow paine's accidental death. dixon, however, isn't the only one to experience misfortune as morgan, a successful model loses her job because of all the trouble surrounding her. her father, who'd some years earlier been awarded a diploma for assisting the police, unjustly finds himself charged with a crime he did not commit. ken paine who'd been a war hero had experienced unemployment and a loss of self esteem which led to alcoholism and wife beating and scalise who'd been set up in business by dixon's father also suffers his own misfortunes.where the sidewalk ends is a thoroughly engaging tale involving a group of interesting and diverse characters and a main protagonist who is the absolute personification of moral ambiguity.\",\n",

       " \"one of the more satisfying western all'italiana, johnny yuma has the freshness of many wai made during the heyday of the genre and is highly recommended for fans of the genre or offbeat, intelligent cinema.johnny yuma is, in most respects, not terribly original, but this actually does not count against it. the success of a genre film depends on how well it meets the audience's expectations as well as provides surprising variations on these expected elements. earlier, pleasing experiences are recreated but with subtle (or major) twist that provide continuing interest. the quality of the execution is also, obviously, important. a tired retread will be less successful than a sincere attempt to entertain or move the audience.given these criteria, johnny yuma succeeds. there are numerous reprises of elements from earlier films. the setting is the brutal, twisted semifeudal twilight world of shared by many of the best gothic family westerns made 19641968 such as tempo di massacre (1966). the plot is a combination of the basic fistful of dollars (1964) plot and the ringo films, a fact not surprising as screenwriter fendiando di leo was involved in both. di leo was one of the best screenwriters in the popular cinema coming out of cinecitta in the 1960s70s and his work helped provide much of the thematic continuities and coherency to the genre (along with a couple of other personalities in a few distinct circles of actors, directors, and screenwriters). in the fod plot, the protagonist arrives in town, stirs up a tense situation, then undergoes a neardeath followed by a resurrection (in some films, like quella sporca storia nel west (1968) it is quite literally a crucifixion). the catholic undertone to the narrative and the symbolism is intriguing, especially given the implicit populistexplicit socialist leanings of the filmmakers and their films. the ringo plot, developed more fully by screenwriter ernesto gastaldi in a series of films starring guliano gemma, a egoistic protagonist chooses the interest of a community over his own through the medium of a relationship with a member of that community (with a healthy dash ironic uncertainty).the relationship between carradine and johnny is clearly based on that of mancomortimer from a fistful of dollar (1965). the two scene of the exchange of the gun belts provides a clever dialog and understanding between the two. numerous films, including da uomo a uomo (1968) or even el chuncho, quién sabe (1967), use this relationship between an older and younger man (fatherson, olderyounger brother, anglo adviseradversary and peasant revolutionary) as a central dynamic to the plot.additionally, there is the focus on deception and misdirection, mazes and mirrors, that recur throughout the best early wai. the canons and pueblos of almeria become literal mazes through which protagonist and antagonist play shifting games of cat and mouse.what distinguishes johnny yuma from other wai is the quality of director romolo guerriri's use of visualpsychological space together arrangement with the script's intelligent mechanisms to forward the plot. dialogue was never very important to the wai and often absurdly unintelligible (thought there are exceptions, such as the cynical commentaries in django (1966) or faccia a faccia (1967).psychological depth of character is created almost entirely through iconic imagery, it's juxtapositions, and it's description of the overall narrative situation. see how the presence of the deadly samantha is felt during the beating scene \\x96 watching from the roof or from the background of the action. or how johnny strips samantha and pedro of their security and confidence in their power through his stealthy invasions of their ranch, hotel, even bedroom (this, again, is a theme from fod). finally, note how there is a focus on the search for information. like many elements, this is borrowed from fod which was ultimately based on the hardboiled mystery novel red harvest. it is through incidental contacts, wanted posters, overheard conversations, glances out of windows, watches left in the dust, or mistaken identities and movements through the ripples created by the actions of pedro and samantha within this surreal and absurd reality that the narrative tacks forward to it's conclusion.the movie was notable in it's time for what were perceived of as excesses in violence. of course, these films were hardly more violent than many american westerns. what was different was the psychological intensity of the violence and the causes to which it was attributed, which is to say that it was not the violence but it's meaning that had changed. johnny yuma is distinct and interesting in it's use and portrayal of violence and this is another interesting aspect of the film.what i personally find most interesting about most of this genre is the link it provides to the anonymous, nameless audiences in italy and spain to whom these recurrent narratives held some significance and interest. the artifact may have no intrinsic worth in and of itself \\x96 some flint debitage from a prehistoric site, a shard of cruse pottery, or a moldering piece of leather and rusted metal \\x96 but it is reference to some nameless presence, lives, that were significant simply because they existed. while johnny yuma has intrinsic

       " \"before the devil knows you're dead starts off promisingly, setting up a simple heist that goes awry, told from varying perspectives (in rashomon style). at around the hour mark, sidney lumet transforms this film into something that is so much more than the sum of its parts; it eventually morphs into a multifaceted family drama, exploring the full realm of human emotionsrelations, as the story comes to its chilling climax.as is the case with lumet, he manages to coax exceptional performances out of his starstudded cast, without any notion of overacting or hyperbole. philip seymour hoffman, in one of his best roles, is a complex, mysterious, and interesting character, and oftentimes dwarfs ethan hawke, who plays his brother, hank. that's not to say that hawke is not bad; in fact he is quite above adequate, in a troubled role that suits his style. marisa tomei is excellent for her relatively short appearance (the fact that she bares her flesh adds to this). albert finney's character (andy and hank's father) is the most intriguing, and in my opinion, he deserved a bit more screentime. amy ryan also performs her job adequately.before the devil knows you're dead is not an exceptional movie, but it proves that lumet is still near the top of his game at the (apparent) twilight of an illustrious career. many of his characteristics and trademarks appear here, not least of which involves the use of his characters. infused with a killer script (no pun intended), smart dialogue and pacing, and a decent score, before the devil knows you're dead is a mustsee. a truly underrated gem. 810. 3 stars (out of 4). should just enter my top 250 at 248. highly recommended.\",\n",

       " \"before 'zavet' there was similarity between tim burton and kusturica artistic vision. they find their own, poetic style, and then they cowardly become prisoners of it. burton has (and still have) depp, kusturica has miki manojlovic, and somehow they got critical praise for repeating same formula over and over again. however, there are persons like me who find joke funny only when they heard it first time. that's main reason why kusturica's worst movies are 'black cat white cat' and 'life is miracle'. 'zavet' is something completely different. you may like it, you may hate it, but this is not just another kusturica poetic \\x96 balkanic dreamlike stuff. of course, if you want to be praised, you have to play safe. it was very easy for kusturica to make just another flying gypsies movie and get award. fortunately, as a brave person he chooses to make movie that will be ironic look to his previous works. 'zavet' can be described as a strong and very harsh parody on previous kusturica movies directed by kusturica himself. it is beautiful to see one big movie director to not take himself too seriously. this is quality that kusturica have and even the biggest, like bergman or kubrick, didn't have. this movie is so meaningless that becomes absurd, so absurd that becomes deep, and so unfunny that becomes hilarious. same stuff that make 'plan 9 from outer space' cult would made this masterpiece to people who knows how to watch it. average western viewer would not get few references. most notable, tire shop owner is srbljanovic , and this refers to biljana srbljanovic, famous serbian dramatic writer. politically, she is very active as left oriented liberal, and she despises kusturica's political views and anarchism. kusturica's 'everything but not subtle' take to her work was to castrate miki manojlovic in srbljanovic shop. second reference is made to goran bregovic \\x96 previous kusturica's composer. he formed 'funeral and wedding orchestra' and start performing around europe. although he is praised as big composer, bregovic is just performer and most of his songs (if not all) are poor covers of traditional serbian songs. kusturica's take on bregovic was to confront one wedding and one funeral, with funeral mocking the wedding. also, music is covering western classics as 'london bridge is falling down' or french lullabies. you find this unfunny now you see how we feel in serbia when listening bregovic's horrible covers. i really liked this movie because it is not pretending to be deep, it is so overfilled with symbols that it becomes parody, and it is beautifully directed, as all of his works are. if you like previous kusturica's movies, there is a big chance that you will hate this. if you don't like couple of his last movies, you may find this as pleasant surprise, because this is like fellini directing 'pink flamingos'. on purpose. i have massive respect for this guy after 'zavet'. next tim burton movie would surely have main character with pale faces. next kusturica movies can easily be about aliens invading earth. that's the reason why he is most interesting director on earth, whether you like it or not.\",\n",
       " \"but i doubt many were running to see this movie. or some came running out of the cinema. okay, that's a bit harsh.the film starts in an unintentionally comical way: frankieboy comes back to his hometown after many years (this already smells of clichés) and the whole town is shaken by his arrival: he is talked about, everyone wants to talk to him, and every woman he meets flirts with him like there's no tomorrow  even his niece hints that she would gladly have dropped her date to chat with frankieboy a little longer even his pretty niece wants a piece of him sounds like one of those laughable mike hammer episodes where every single female wants stacey keach. and, like stacey keach, frankieboy is anything but a goodlooking woman's wet dream. in real life, someone like sinatra (without the fame) wouldn't get within 100 m of someone as beautiful as maclaine. but in this hollywood movie it's the other way around: maclaine is absolutely nuts about frankieboy, but he couldn't care less sinatra plays his cool shtick much too often in his movies, and it is rarely credible. dean martin is kind of miscast; he isn't miscast as a cardplayer, but rather because of the accent which simply doesn't suit him. maclaine is charming as ever, but she plays a caricature  and this reliance on caricatures is one of the basic problems with the film. the main characters are all some sort of stereotypes out of bad or seenitallbefore movies and cheap novels; frankie is the cool cat who comes back to town to get all the women, and he couldn't care less about his writing (which, predictably, eventually garners recognition); martin is a sleazy but friendly cardplayer; maclaine is the dumb, but very likable bimbo; frankie's blond loveinterest is a snotty literary expert; frankie's brother is the successful guy who married into his wife's business and has a lousy marriage; and so on. clichés.the story contains a couple of coincidences which are a little too farfetched for my taste: frankie just happens to bump into his niece in a locale; his niece just happens to be meters away from her daddy when the latter kisses his secretary for the first time; and then there is the awful, stupid ending.in it, a drunk guy bent on killing frankieboy somehow manages to find him in a carnival of all places the place is utterly crowded, with the typical noise and chaos  plus it's happening in the evening  and yet the guy somehow finds frankie (in spite of being drunk as a doorknob) and shoots at him. but guess who he kills maclaine. she jumps in front of the bullet to save frankie: a cliché which comicbook writers might cringe at. this utterly pathetic, overdramatic, and annoying ending certainly cannot please any, even semiintelligent, viewer. and this happens on the same day that maclaine and sinatra got married the writer of this nonsense seems to have read crappy dime novels his whole life  how else is the writing of this movie to be explained there is even a card game in which a brawl ensues with frankie & martin vs. some cliché caricatures out of the writer's vivid imagination. (it was like a damn western suddenly.) another dumb thing is the way sinatra was crazy about the boring snottynosed bimbo and pretty much ignored maclaine. as the movie progresses we find out that sinatra finds maclaine to be too dumb for him, just as the blond bimbo finds sinatra to be too lowclass for her. there is a certain snobbism and disdain to be detected in the script regarding maclaine. maclaine is treated as worthless by everyone, while the blond bimbo is treated as a princess and an intellectual; the ironic truth is that the latter's character comes off as rather dumb and not at all as intellectual; her behaviour, comments, and opinions are mostly clichéd, silly, confused, pretentious, and primitive. at least maclaine's character knows that she (maclaine) is dumb. there is another irony that i didn't fail to notice: sinatra had trouble finding an ending for his latest story  much like the writer of this movie, and that's why he came up with the corny, crappy finale.the film basically has a solid cast, and the photography is nice, but the script, though sometimes okay, relies to heavily on silly nonsense instead of on realitybased characters and events.if you're interested in reading my biographies of shirley maclaine and other hollywood intellectuals, contact me by email.\",\n",
       " \"when a man who doesn't have alzheimer's can't remember how many films he's made, he probably is the world's most prolific director after all. that man is jesus franco, the king of socalled 'eurotrash'. his 1980 flick devil hunter is as rushed, opaque, stupid, lazy and exploitative in the truest sense of the word (the film's title is misleading, for starters) as any other franco film i've seen. that makes it sound pretty awful, and it is... yet franco does have some kind of inimitable sensibility, a generous way with the baldly outrageous, with nudity and sleaze and violence, and even with his stupid cheap editing which tries to pave over the extreme haste with which all his films were made. the mix of all these elements causes you to ride his films out, even while you're mostly waiting for them to end because they're so very tedious.devil hunter is nigh on incomprehensible for the first half an hour. the kidnap by strangers of a white woman who seems to be a model or film star is intercut with a bunch of native action in south america. there's lots of naked writhing, dancing, and endless repeated zoomins on an ugly totem pole. you need to get used to the repetitive zoomins and the technique of cutting back to the same shot about three times in a row right away, as these are franco's main methods of extending a film out to feature length.the monster who looks like the totem pole is actually kind of scary. he has raw bug eyes and his presence is always signalled on the soundtrack by cacophonous groaning, apparently recorded in an echo chamber. early in the piece he chews on a native lady strapped to a tree, and it's hard to know what really happens here but i think he ate her stomach (or her genitals, sweet jesus).anyway, the adventure begins properly when a studly guy and his freaked out vietnam vet pal are sent to the island to recover the white girl from the kidnappers. the flakey guy has an accent which, as dubbed, is half brooklynamerican, half englishliverpudlian and all retarded. all of the dialogue and dubbing is ridiculous and laughable, making for another layer of the film which can somehow hold your interest.not too much really happens from here on in, and it happens pretty sluggishly, studded with the odd bit of outrage like a rape. the nebulous action is fleshed out (haha) by acres of 360 degree nudity from the natives and the two female leads, and even from the monster himself. that he walks around with his penis exposed makes wrestling him an unappetising prospect for the tough guy hero, but it's gotta be done at some point, and it's nice to note that the director will show anyone's genitals on camera.the best feature of devil hunter is the location filming. franco can be extremely cheap with the structural and story aspects of filmmaking, but he doesn't muck around with sets. you get real islands, jungles, helicopters and mountains, all in widescreen. this is something that is really cool to experience in these days of crappy cgi sets and backdrops ad nauseam.ultimately, issues of recommendation where this film is concerned seem moot. if you're trying to see all the video nasties, you will have to watch this at some point, and you'll be made as restless as i was. if you like franco, you'll watch this anyway. if you fall into neither of the above categories, the odds are you'll never come across this film. copies of it aren't just lying around, and i could hardly recommend the seeking out of it. it's franco. lazy, crazy franco.\",\n",

       " \"you know, robin williams, god bless him, is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these dumb comedies he has done this decade (with perhaps the exception of death to smoochy, which bombed when it came out but is now a cult classic). the dramas he has made lately have been fantastic, especially insomnia and one hour photo. the night listener, despite mediocre reviews and a quick dvd release, is among his best work, period.this is a very chilling story, even though it doesn't include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter. the concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed. in high school, i read an autobiography by a child named anthony godby johnson, who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted aids as a result. i was moved by the story until i read reports online that johnson may not actually exist. when i saw this movie, the confused feelings that robin williams so brilliantly portrayed resurfaced in my mind.toni collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too as the ultimately sociopathic caretaker. her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like little miss sunshine. there were even times she looked into the camera where i thought she was staring right at me. it takes a good actress to play that sort of role, and it's this understated (yet well reviewed) role that makes toni collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an academy award (as of 2008). it's incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this, and it's scary too.this is a good, dark film that i highly recommend. be prepared to be unsettled, though, because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end.\",\n",

       " 'surely one of the most illadvised remakes of a classic in film history – especially since the promise of its tagline, “the most beautiful woman of our time in the most erotic adventure of all time”, isn’t even properly exploited although this film was regularly shown on tv in my neck of the woods since my childhood days, its notoriety (for awfulness not erotic content, mind you) kept me away from it until now – and i only relented because i have recently enjoyed bo derek’s previous film, 10 (1979), and have been watching a lot of fantasy stuff as well over the christmas period.lead actressproducer bo derek is rather ridiculous playing the schoolgirlish sexual innocent (witness the inept banana scene) and, as was to be expected, she is made to get her clothes off a few times but, as welcome as these scenes were, she came off as far more sensual in 10 than she does here; richard harris, then, chews the scenery incessantly as jane’s obsessed explorer father, but john philip law barely registers as his aide who meekly shows some initial interest in jane herself; newcomer miles o’keeffe has the title role and he only makes his entrance 45 minutes into the movie, is completely silent throughout except for his famous yodel (which is probably lifted from johnny weissmuller anyway) and, furthermore, is as inexpressive as one of the trees he dangles from at regular intervals throughout the film’s second half; for the record, he later starred in two ator movies (or wouldbe conan imitators) for joe d’amato and the king arthurera set, sword of the valiant (1984).when still an actor, director john derek (who also serves as his own cinematographer here) had worked with some good filmmakers (cecil b. de mille, william dieterle and robert rossen) and a few great ones (otto preminger, nicholas ray and don siegel) but he clearly learned zilch from them as his direction of this one is a major liability: appallingly pretentious at times (witness the perfectly horrid python attack sequence) with a senseless overuse of the slow motion technique and cheesy transitions; this was derek’s seventh film as a director (and his second of four with wife bo) and, eventually, he would only get to make two more.the film’s utter failure only needs to be gauged by the fact that the tarzan legend was tackled once more on film – in greystoke: the legend of tarzan, lord of the apes (which, surprisingly enough, i haven’t watched myself yet) – a mere three years later nominated for six razzie awards (including john derek, richard harris and miles o’keeffe) and winning one for bo derek herself, tarzan, the ape man was cowritten by gary goddard, the future director of another highly anticipated but ultimately disappointing transposition to the silver screen of a (this time animated) heroic figure, master of the universe (1987) which i will be revisiting presently as well (yay) despite a charming closing credit sequence showing tarzan and jane playing with around with an orangutan and a music score that is not half bad actually and quite rousing on occasion, any belated good intentions are defeated by an extremely silly climax involving natives painting bo completely white and, fatally, john derek’s clear disinterest in the character of tarzan himself which makes him come off as an unimportant supporting character in his own selftitled movie',\n",

       " \"joseph l. mankiewicz's sleuth didn't need a remake. it's a thoroughly well made film that stands up well to this day. however, given that the modern day remake machine is currently in full swing; i really can't say i'm surprised to see the film updated for modern audience. the plot remains identical to the original film and at its core we have the story of a young man, milo tindle, who goes off to see an older man, andrew wyke, to discuss a divorce as the younger man is having an affair with the older man's wife. from there, a game of cat and mouse ensues. its clear right from the outset that director kenneth branagh wanted to add a different touch to this film and he does so by way of the central location, which has been changed from the charming gamesridden country house of the original to a technical marvel kitted out with layers of security equipment. i'm glad that the director chose to make this change as nobody wants to see a remake that directly copies of the original; plus there's the fact that the location is well used and always nice to look at. unfortunately, however, the positive elements of sleuth 2007 end there.the original film was over two hours long, while this remake is only just a shade over eighty minutes. naturally, therefore, that means that this version has less about it; and unfortunately it's the characters that suffer. the plot is also rushed and we get into the first twist in the tale far too quickly and before we are given any chance to actually understand why and how these events can be taking place. the film does not build the characters, or the rapport between them, enough to make sure that their relationship makes sense. one major thing that has been changed about the older character is his obsession; in the original he was obsessed with games which turned out to be very important once the twists come into play. here he has some kind of security fetish that doesn't really mean anything by the end. kenneth branagh's handling of the film allows for a classy score but the class ends there. the original thrived on it, but this film is happy merely to soil itself with expletives on numerous, and mostly unwarranted, occasions; which cheapen the whole thing. the final twist in the tale is completely different to how it was in the original and ensures that the film boils down to a really hideous conclusion. after spending two hours with the original i understood, respected and liked both characters presented in the film  after eighty minutes of this, i hated them both. i do have some respect for branagh for not merely rolling out a carbon copy of the original film; but this is not a good adaptation of the great anthony shaffer play.\",\n",

       " \"the saddest thing about this film is that only 8 people cared to leave a review of it and noone felt it worthwhile leaving a comment on the message boards.made the same year as philadelphia...the tom hanks oscarwinner... this is the film that people really should have seen and given awards to. there is more humanity, life, love, tenderness and beauty in these two people than in just about any other gay film i have seen... and it is all true.in order for this to be printed i need to leave a few more lines of text: suffice it to say that anyone who really wants to know what it was like to be gay in the 60's and 70's, and to understand just what aids was like before the modern drug cocktails allowed people to breathe a little easier... this is the film to see. oh, and i will add a personal comment about aids. despite everything, there actually has been a silver lining to all the horror. when aids first arrived, it was called the gay cancer, and governments preferred to let them die rather than spend a red cent on research to help save a bunch of fags. then it became clear that aids would also be a heterosexual disease. but the government wasn't ready for that; so when straight people began getting ill too, the only organizations and associations that were available to them were those which had been set up by gays themselves (examples: the names project: the quilt memorializing all those who died of aids; act up etc) the result is that people who probably would never have come in contact with gays in their ordinary lives suddenly found themselves counting on them and needing them, because no other organizations existed. this close contact, in my estimation, is what finally broke down the barriers of prejudice and allowed the straight world to finally accept gays as equals. when aids first came on the scene, many of us thought that the straight world would use it as a way to come down even harder on us... and that probably would have been true if straights didn't suddenly become ill too; nevertheless, the strides that have been made in gay liberation  to the point that, as i write this, there are at least 5 countries in the world that accept gay marriage  these gains would probably have taken a lot longer without aids to bring us together. it is sad to think that all those people  both straight and gay  had to die before our common humanity became more obvious  but if what i am writing here is true, and i think it is  then there is a bit of comfort to be taken in realizing that all those people did not die in vain.\",\n",

       " \"prolific and highly influential filmmaker martin scorsese examines a selection of his favorite american films grouped according to three different types of directors: the director as an illusionist: d.w. griffith or f. w. murnau, who created new editing techniques among other changes that made the appearance of sound and color later step forward; the director as a smuggler: filmmakers such as douglas sirk, samuel fuller, and mostly vincente minnelli, directors who used to disguise rebellious messages in their films; and the director as iconoclast: those filmmakers attacking civil observations and social hangups like orson welles, erich von stroheim, charles chaplin, nicholas ray, stanley kubrick, and arthur penn.he shows us how the old studio system in hollywood was, though oppressive, the way in which film directors found themselves progressing the medium because of how they were bound by political and financial limitations. during his clips from the movies he shows us, we not only discover films we've never seen before that pique our interest but we also are made to see what he sees. he evaluate his stylistic sensibilities along with the directors of the sequences themselves.the idea of a film canon has been reputed as snobbish, hence some movie fans and critics favor to just make lists. however, canon merely denotes the best and supporters of film canon argue that it is a valuable activity to identify and experience a select compilation of the best films, a lot like a greatest hits tape, if just as a beginning direction for film students. all in all, one's experience has shown that all writing about film, including reviews, function to construct a film canon. some film canons can definitely be elitist, but others can be populist. as an example, the internet movie database's top 250 movies list includes many films included on several elitist film canons but also features recent hollywood blockbusters at which many film elitists scoff, like the dark knight, which presently mingles in the top ten amidst the first two godfather films, schindler's list and one flew over the cuckoo's nest, and the fluctuation of similar productions further down such as iron man, sin city, die hard, the terminator and kill bill: vol. 2. writer scorsese's taxi driver paul schrader has straightforwardly referred to his canon as elitist and contends that this is positive.scorsese is never particularly vocal at all about his social and political ideologies, but when we see this intense and admittedly obsessive history lesson on the birth and growth of american cinema in both ideological realms, we see that there is really no particular virtue in either elitism or populism. elitism concentrates all attention, recognition and thus power on those deemed outstanding. that discrimination could easily lead to selfindulgence much in the vein of the condescending work of jeanluc godard or the overrationalization of the production practices of a filmmaker like michael haneke. yet populism invokes a belief of representative freedom as being only the assertion of the people's will. as has been previously asserted about the allencompassing misconceptions the people have about cinema, populism could be the end of the potential power and impact of cinema. one can only continue seeing films, because it is a vital social and metaphysical practice. and that's what martin scorsese spends nearly four hours here trying to tell us, something which can't be told without being seen firsthand.\",\n",

       " \"as with all of angelopoulos' films, the suspended step of the stork implicitly demands a close and intimate participation on the part of the viewer, a fact that has certainly contributed to the limited popularity of his work. dialogues are sparing, with no monologues or exchanges exteriorizing the characters' inner conflicts, doubts, or feelings. the filmmaker prefers to keep the viewers away from their own emotional responses, and instead forces them to explore and study the characters' identities for themselves. as a result, the acting is understated and implicit, as opposed to overt and explicit.the action scenes are set between long intervals of contemplation, where the viewer is asked to become a participant, to participate as an actor, by probing his or her own psyche. as in a novel, where the drama rests entirely on the author's writing to provide a template where the reader's imagination andor past experience flourish, angelopoulos' drama rests within his images: his uses of the long shots, the long takes, the leisurely pacing, the sparing dialogues that have become his trademark, inviting the viewer to experience the film from his or her personal perspective. angelopoulos uses silence to capture moments of high intensity, reverting to the nonverbal language of gestures, gazes, sounds, and music, when he believes that words can only take us so far.the music, by angelopoulos' long time collaborator, eleni karaindrou, provides more than just a discreet background, but becomes itself a dramatic element of the story. a large part of the film consists of exterior shots in subtle, subdued colors, recorded in a drab winter light. angelopoulos presents us with an other greece, one far different from the greece of the tourist brochures, with ethereal blue skies and emerald seas, drowned in an eternal sunshine. here, the skies are covered and gray, the air is cold and misty, and the sands of the pristine beaches have been replaced by the trampled, dirty snow of the village streets. angelopoulos' genius through arvanitis' camera is on display throughout the film.the suspended step of the stork is above all else a political statement aimed at the sociopolitical situation in the balkans at the end of the twentieth century. it is deeply concerned with the meaning of borders, and with those who are the victims of the confusion between nations. in the waiting room facing the albanian border, the refugees, political or other, outcast by the rest of humanity, wait. they may be stuck against a political border, but unfortunately they still carry with them, and hang on, deeper ancestral borders: those of the languages, of the customs, and of the races. although angelopoulos' political views are well known, the film steers clear of any political discourse regarding the causes of the refugees' plights. in the process, angelopoulos forces us to meditate on the concepts of geographical, cultural, political, and personal borders. angelopoulos considers himself a historian of twentieth century greece, and he likes to bring lessons from the hellenic myths into his discussions. in this film, he does some border crossing himself between the greek and italian cultures, drawing from a combined homeric and dantesque tradition of odysseus' travel. alexander is a telemachus, in search of a story about an aging greek politicianodysseus who disappeared, never to be heard of again. this political man, a brilliant orator, unexpectedly and inexplicably left the comfort of his bourgeois existence, his wife, and his brilliant career, to live anonymously in a refugee camp with the lowest of the low. he became a poet in exile wondering how to change the world. of course, the politician is not alexander's father, but the politician stands before alexander like a father figureodysseus. as with homer's telemachus, alexander grows as a person during his odyssey.of course, it would be wrong to try and see in the film a retelling of homer's odyssey in a contemporary context. angelopoulos draws on odysseus's travels only as structuring and thematic elements for his film. in angelopoulos' ending, odysseus is more like the dante's odysseus: he does not leave for ithaca but goes on, carrying a suitcase. and alexandertelemachus is suspended between returning to his home and his career, or embarking on a voyage to somewhere else. he states as much, in a voiceover at the beginning of the film, paraphrasing few lines from dante's inferno: and don't forget that the time for a voyage has come again. the wind blows your eyes far away. finally, although angelopoulos is not a religious person, there is a greek orthodox religious theme introduced during the film in the form of the yellowsuited linesmen, who go around bettering things for their fellow human beings by reconnecting communications, and also the christlike figure of the politician. in the final scene, these men in yellow demonstrate once more the byzantine iconography's influence in angelopoulos' work. they appear like stylites, religious figures found in the orthodox tradition, solitary and fervent men who took up their abode upon the tops of pillars, in a form of asceticism.the film ends without a resolution as to the true identity of the character played by mastroianni. angelopoulos does not give us any clues, and the wife's statement, it's not him, is far from convincing and left ambiguous enough. the important question of the film is not whether he is or is not the vanished politician, but that he could be the politician. but the film still ends on an optimistic note. whereas the wires strung from pole to pole run only along the river, and thus communications across the border are still not possible, and it remains impenetrable, we note that this final scene is taken from a point of view across the river: the camera has crossed the border, and the reverse tracking shot is inviting alexander and the viewer to follow beyond the boundary. on this account, angelopoulos gives us hope that somehow, some of the borders will eventually crumble.\",\n",

       " \"new best friend is another entry in the steal another woman's life subgenre; the best of which are single white female and the hand that rocks the cradle; the worse of which you can catch almost any afternoon on the lifetime channel. for some reason this type of identity theft happens exclusively to women.there are just two basic ways to play this type of story. you can make the woman evil at the beginning and let the audience watch knowingly as she hatches and implements her evil scheme. or you use misdirection to make her appear a good person, as a seemingly unplanned series of events break in her favor until she is revealed to be evil in the climatic scene. unfortunately the makers of new best friend could not decide how they wanted to play it and things crash and burn early. we first meet alicia (mia kirshner) scamming the college's financial aid office for scholarship money. we now know that she is a bad person and will view all her subsequent activity with suspicion. but the director and editor apparently forgot that this revelation had been made and spend the next 50 minutes laying misdirection to make us think that alicia is a good person. this introduces the only element of suspense, not about whether she is evil but about when the director and editor will wise up and stop wasting our time with transparent misdirection.new best friend suffers more than most from the teen movie curse of a cast too old to be portraying undergraduate students. there are really only two big parts, hadley (meredith monroe) and alicia (kirshner). they were 31 and 26 respectively at the time of the production. it almost works for the 26 yearold kirshner when she plays the mousy version of alicia but it becomes glaring when she is transformed into the glamedup version of alicia. monroe's casting is simply a joke, about like having nicholette sheridan try to pass as a classmate on lizzie mcgwire. she looks much closer to a midlife crisis than to a term paper.the producers must have owed a lot of favors because this age issue extends to most of the supporting characters. taye diggs who plays the town sheriff is younger than most of the students.the basic setup is that hadley and two other rich party girls (played by dominque swainage 21 and rachel trueage 35) are undergrad roommates at college. they share (as their student residence) a mansion that is nicer and better furnished than the mansion on real worldnew orleans (a premise more believable than soccer moms playing students). alicia moves into the mansion and begins to take over hadley's life. at least that way swain finally gets a roommate from her own generation so the two can have a lesbian scene. swain's supporting performance is the only good thing about new best friend and her love scene with kirshner is fantastic, so cool and artsy that it doesn't fit with any of the other segments, maybe it was subcontracted out to a good director and cinematographer.the unintentionally hilarious story is presented in a series of dreary flashbacks of rampant sex and nonstop parties, each proceeded by a shot of a comatose alicia in a hospital bed. about half of kirshner's screen time is spent lying motionless with a tube in her mouth. not a good career move mia.then again, what do i know i'm only a child.\",\n",

(so theoretically, it is possible for a contestant on this dreary debacle to actually wind up owing shatner money.) there is also a killer card and if the contestant picks the girl who has that vile scroll, but he has answered properly, nothing happens. if he's answered wrong, the game goes into sudden death and has to answer another question. if he gets that one wrong, he leaves with nothing.before going to commercials, shatner yells, let's dance and shatner, the contestant and the 12 dancers shake booty. at the end of the show, shatner asks the ladies for a last dance and they all shake it some more.i give this show 6 episodes at the very most, at which time hopefully this pathetic excuse for a game will be shown the door.

       " \"i saw shiner on dvd. while i was watching it, i thought, this is a really bad porn flick without the porn. i also thought, whoever wrote this has some real issues. then i watched the directorwriter carlson explain his process as a special feature. yeah, it was real special.the emphasis of the film is placed on two alcoholic losers who hit each other to get off. they are marginally attractive. there is frontal and full nudity. these factors probably account for the film being seen at all.the most upsetting element of the film is the gay bashing and the subsequent further gay bashing of the same victim who tries ineptly to exact revenge from his assailants, the two drunken losers. not only is the subject handled absurdly and badly from a technical point of view, but the acting is horrendously bad.then there's the boxerstalker theme. this is really insane, not just absurd. this hunky boxer is somehow traumatized by the persistent attentions of a fleshy momma's boy who works at his gym's parking lot. this is in la, mind you. the boxer is so traumatized that he turns up at the stalker's house, strips in front of him and gets excited in the process.well, all i can say is, why would a boxer who is at heart an exhibitionist be so traumatized by the attention of a stalker it simply makes no sense. and, i'm afraid, some psychodynamics actually do make sense, if you take the time to read about them. however, bad scripts seldom make sense at all.the directorwriter seems to have thought that this film represents a considerable minority within the gay community. well, he may be correct, i suppose. we may never know, since that minority would be so dysfunctional they would hardly be able to get organized enough to ever get to an obscure gay film festival or dvd store, the only two places they could possibly find this turkey. thank goodness for that.\",\n",

       " \"'thunderbirds' was an immensely popular sixties show that has transcended the years and generations to the point it is still as popular now, with both adults and children alike, as it was in its heyday. so, one would deduce the chance to produce a liveaction feature film with a million pound hollywood budget was an excellent opportunity to revive the series as has been done with 'spiderman' and 'the xmen'. but a terrible storyline and bland acting obliterated this opportunity and it was soon apparent all that was destined for this film was a trip to the bargain bin of the kiddies' section.instead of a film focusing on the five tracey sons, their father and trusty geek brain striving to rescue people and protect the world from villains, our hero in this drudge is a malcontent and bratty thirteenyearold alan tracey, fourteenyearold tintin and tenyearold brainbox fermat, son of brains (yes, brains' son despite this being a man who could surely never score a woman if he tried; maybe he grew the kid in a petri dish). as one can tell from a runthrough of our three lead characters, this 2004 remake 'thunderbirds' was clearly aimed at entertaining only children under twelve instead of trying to appeal to a broad agerange as those involved in the much superior revival of 'spiderman' did. the plot itself was so bland with clunky, awkward dialogue and weak jokes that probably wouldn't amuse brighter preteens. the scriptwriter seemed more interested in ripping off 'spy kids' (which was at least quirky and original) instead of remaking the show people know and love.although sophia myles and ron cook were excellent as miss penelope and parker, they only had about three lines between them so their presence was barely felt. bill paxton's jeff tracey was just boring and there was only the slightest of mention of the other four tracey boys while anthony edwards and ben kingsley, as brains and the hood respectively, were just embarrassing. the hood, in particular, is not at all threatening or sinister and instead comes across as a campy, twobit stereotypical villain as limp as a piece of rotting lettuce.brady corbet, who plays alan tracey, may well be a good young actor but it was hard to see that in a film where he plays a whinging brat who just grates and the same goes for vanessa anne hutchinson as tintin since the most she gets to do is look pretty and be all for 'girl power'. ironically, it is young soren fulton's fermat who is the only interesting character of the film as fulton delivers a natural and relaxed performance.'thunderbirds' the series will be forever remembered as an excellent show that proves puppets can give solid performances 'thunderbirds' the film will be forgotten by most and remembered by a few as one big flop.\",\n",

       " \"if saura hadn't done anything like this before, iberia would be a milestone. now it still deserves inclusion to honor a great director and a great cinematic conservator of spanish culture, but he has done a lot like this before, and though we can applaud the riches he has given us, we have to pick and choose favorites and high points among similar films which include blood wedding (1981), carmen (1983), el amore brujo (1986), sevillanas (1992), salomé (2002) and tango (1998). i would choose saura's 1995 flamenco as his most unique and potent cultural document, next to which iberia pales.iberia is conceived as a series of interpretations of the music of isaac manuel francisco albéniz (18601909) and in particular his iberia suite for piano. isaac albéniz was a great contributor to the externalization of spanish musical culture  its reformatting for a nonspanish audience. he moved to france in his early thirties and was influenced by french composers. his iberia suite is an imaginative synthesis of spanish folk music with the styles of liszt, dukas and d'indy. he traveled around performing his compositions, which are a kind of beautiful standardization of spanish rhythms and melodies, not as homogenized as ravel's bolero but moving in that direction. naturally, the spanish have repossessed albéniz, and in iberia, the performers reinterpret his compositions in terms of various more ethnic and regional dances and styles. but the source is a tamed and diluted form of spanish musical and dance culture compared to the echt spanishness of pure flamenco. flamenco, coming out of the region of andalusia, is a deeply felt amalgam of gitane, hispanoarabic, and jewish cultures. iberia simply is the peninsula comprising spain, portugal, andorra and gibraltar; the very concept is more diluted. saura's flamenco is an unstoppably intense ethnic mix of music, singing, dancing and that peacock manner of noble preening that is the essence of spanish style, the way a man and a woman carries himself or herself with pride verging on arrogance and elegance and panache  even bullfights and the moves of the torero are full of it  in a series of electric sequences without introduction or conclusion; they just are. saura always emphasized the staginess of his collaborations with choreographer antonio gades and other artists. in his 1995 flamenco he dropped any pretense of a story and simply has singers, musicians, and dancers move on and off a big sound stage with nice lighting and screens, flats, and mirrors arranged by cinematographer vittorio storaro, another of the spanish filmmaker's important collaborators. the beginnings and endings of sequences in flamenco are often rough, but atmospheric, marked only by the rumble and rustle of shuffling feet and a mixture of voices. sometimes the film keeps feeding when a performance is over and you see the dancer bend over, sigh, or laugh; or somebody just unexpectedly says something. in flamenco more than any of saura's other musical films it's the rapt, intense interaction of singers and dancers and rhythmically clapping participant observers shouting impulsive olé's that is the story and creates the magic. because saura has truly made magic, and perhaps best so when he dropped any sort of conventional story.iberia is in a similar style to some of saura's purest musical films: no narration, no dialogue, only brief titles to indicate the type of song or the region, beginning with a pianist playing albeniz's music and gradually moving to a series of dance sequences and a little singing. in flamenco music, the fundamental element is the unaccompanied voice, and that voice is the most unmistakable and unique contribution to world music. it relates to other songs in other ethnicities, but nothing quite equals its raw raucous unique uglybeautiful cry that defies you to do anything but listen to it with the closest attention. then comes the clapping and the foot stomping, and then the dancing, combined with the other elements. there is only one flamenco song in iberia. if you love saura's flamenco, you'll want to see iberia, but you'll be a bit disappointed. the style is there; some of the great voices and dancing and music are there. but iberia's source and conception doom it to a lesser degree of power and make it a less rich and intense cultural experience.\",\n",

       " \"1939 is universally accepted as the greatest year in hollywood history, with more classic films released than in any other, and john ford directed three of the best, stagecoach, drums along the mohawk, and this beautiful homage to frontier days and a young backwoods lawyer destined to eventually save the union, young mr. lincoln.with the world plunging into a war that america dreaded, but knew it would be drawn into, abraham lincoln was much on people's minds, in 1939, as someone who had faced the same dilemma in his own life, and had triumphed. on broadway, robert e. sherwood's awardwinning abe lincoln in illinois, with raymond massey's physically deadon portrayal, was playing to packed houses (it would be filmed in 1940). carl sandburg's continuation of his epic biography, abraham lincoln: the war years, was published, and quickly became a best seller. president roosevelt frequently referred to lincoln in speeches, and the lincoln memorial, in washington, d.c., became the most popular landmark in town (a fact that frank capra made good use of, in mr. smith goes to washington).all this was not lost on darryl f. zanuck, at 20th century fox; as soon as he read lamar trotti's screenplay of lincoln's early days as a lawyer, he designated it a 'prestige' production, and assigned john ford to direct, and henry fonda, to star.fonda did not want to play lincoln; he felt he couldn't do justice to the 'great emancipator', and feared a bad performance would damage his career. even a filmed makeup test, in which he was stunned by how much he would resemble lincoln, wouldn't change his mind. according to fonda, john ford, whom he'd never worked with, cussed him out royally, at their first meeting, and explained he wasn't portraying the lincoln of legend, but a young jackanape country lawyer facing his first murder trial. humbled, fonda took the role. (john ford offered a different scenario of the events, but the outcome was the same) obviously, they found a chemistry together that worked, as nearly all of their pairings would produce 'classics'.unlike the introverted, melancholiaracked lincoln of abe lincoln in illinois, ford's vision was that of a shy but likable young attorney, who made friends easily, and misses the mother he lost, too young (resulting in a bond with a pioneer mother that becomes a vital part of the story). injustice riles him, and he speaks 'common sense' to quell violence, interlaced with doses of humor. both productions play on lincoln's (undocumented) relationship with ann rutledge; in ford's version, the pair are truly in love, and committed to each other. after her death, lincoln would frequently visit her grave, to share his life with her 'spirit' (a theme ford would continue in she wore a yellow ribbon).a murder trial is the centerpiece of the film, and shows the prodigious talents of the star and director. fonda deftly portrays lincoln's inexperience, yet earnest belief in justice tempered with mercy, and ford emphasizes the gulf between the bigcity 'intellectuals' (represented by pompous d.a. donald meek, and his slick 'advisor', stephen douglas, played by a young milburn stone), and the informal, rulebending country sense of lincoln. with ford 'regular' ward bond as a key witness, the trial is both unconventional, and riveting.with the film closing as lincoln strides away into the stormy distance, and his destiny (dissolving into a view of the statue at the lincoln memorial), audiences could take comfort in the film's message that if a cause is just, good would ultimately triumph.young mr. lincoln is a truly remarkable film, from an amazing year\",\n",

       " \"shinjuku triad society, albeit from perfect, is a fiercely compelling film for what it tries to depict in its uberconventional realm. it's a yakuzatriad picture, involving cops versus japanese &or chinese gangsters (mostly chinese, as the title suggests), but already even in his first technical 'debut', takashi miike is already establishing many aspects to films that he would make from hereon in. social issues like black market trading of precious goods, in this case human organs usually from children; nostalgia for childhood and one's roots, which was especially prevalent in dead or alive 2; thumbingofthenose at taboos like gay sex and (satirical) rapeviolence towards women; bloodcurdling violence. it's certainly not as surreal as some of miike's most recent films, but this is expected as he's trying out things that he's just starting to learn, following a track record of straight to video programmers. it's got all of those qualities, and it's also, like the films that would follow from it, equally savage and heartfelt, crazy (in spots) and sardonic in its drama, and solid for genre fans.the story concerns two brothers, one a chinese orphan raised in japan, tatsuhito kiriya (kippei shiina, pretty decent as a eastwoodesquire antiherohero), who's become a detective, and another, who's become a gangster, or a wouldbe one. the main arch likely takeover gang comes from wang (a definite pun on what the gang represents during its sparetime, played by tomorowo taguchi as a typical wacko with real terror in his eyes), and his partner karino (takeshi caesar, who's threatening even when just repeating a commandment over and over to a woman who's just had her eye plugged out following a sour deal), who are the ruthless kind to pop up almost organically in a miike movie. there's some intrigue involving the organtrading scheme with the gangsters, which kiriya almost becomes a victim of, and the gang's penchant for gay sex at least with one little puppet of sorts who does whatever the main gangsters want. it all leads up to vengeance and redemption, qualities that miike and his writer are trying to emulate from shakespeare (hence the macbeth bit with wang washing his bloody hangs over and over after some gay sex saying it won't come off).if it doesn't add up to the same emotional level of impact that a great shakespeare play would have, it's par for the course of a film like this. miike's goals are met, though just met, in his lowscale ambitions: a gangster picture with some added levels of harsh familial trouble (the main tension between the brothers comes out of profession and duty to parents), notes on the crueler aspects of underworld crime, and what the realm of unrepentant sex, with both sexes, brings out psychologically in the characters. at the same time, shinjuku triad society also contains more than a few moments of classic biting blackcomedy from the miike oeuvre. some of it just has to be taken with a grain of salt for what the director does in his outrageousness, like the bit at the beginning with the chair smashing over the face, or the randomness of the interrogation as it goes into a very twisted area. there's even a laughoutloud line from the young sexslave after finishing an act on one of the bosses: thank you, mr. weenyburger. miike and his writer don't have enough here to make the film a fullon dark comedy like ichi or, of course, visitor q, but there's enough to bring some appropriate levity to the darker aspects to the story and characters.as the first entry of the black society trilogy, as it's called, i was quite impressed, and it's a fine quasicalling card from one of the craziest new artists in contemporary cinema.\",\n",

       " \"have you ever wished that you could escape your dull and stressful life at school or work and go on a magical adventure of your own, with one of your closest friends at your side, facing all sorts of dangers and villains, and unraveling the mystery of a lost civilization that's just waiting for someone to discover all its secrets even if you're not quite that much of a fantasylover, have you ever wished you could simply experience what it's like to be a kid again, and not have a care in the world, for just a couple of hours this is exactly what miyazaki's castle in the sky is all about. pazu, a young but very brave and ambitious engineer, lives a rustic life in a mining town until one day, a girl named sheeta falls down from the sky like an angel and takes him on a journey to a place far beyond the clouds, while all the while they have pirates and military units hot on their trail. simply put, it is just the incredible adventure that every kid dreams of at one point or another, and i can't help but feel my worries melt away every time i see it.as it is one of miyazaki's older works and takes much place in the everyday world, the film is not as visually spectacular or deep in its storyline as spirited away, howl's moving castle, or even princess mononoke. still, i find it difficult to say that any of these films are superior over the other, because all three of those films are, at some point or another, mystical to the point of being enigmatic, if not perplexing, especially for the youngest of viewers.castle in the sky, on the other hand, doesn't try so much to be an allegory of any kind, and it's not a comingofage story either; it is instead quite possibly one of the best depictions of the inside of a child's mind i've ever seen. not only is the artwork beautiful, but the use of perspective from the kids' eyes is just amazing; whether it's the panning up of the camera to see the enormous trees or clouds overhead, or the incredible sense of height from looking down at the ground or ocean while hundreds of feet in the air, i just can't help but feel like i'm there with pazu and sheeta, just a kid in another world, far far away from reality.even the kids themselves don't have a complex relationship that suggests a need for hope like ashitakasan or chihirohaku; sheeta is pazu's angel, having literally fallen into his life from the sky one day, the absolutely perfect person for him right from the very start. as the film progresses, more and more of their true adventurous childhood spirit comes out through their kind words and beautifully realistic facial expressions. not only are they an adorable reminder of who i used to be, but their endearing friendship never lets up throughout the whole film, only growing stronger all the way to the last frame. for that reason, i've fallen in love with the two of them more than i have with any other miyazaki couple.at the same time, castle in the sky is such an easily accessible film because no matter what kind of casual moviegoer you may be, you'll be sure to find your fix here. mystery, action, drama, comedy, suspense, scifi, romance, even some western...it's all here, just about everything people go to the movies for (except maybe horror). this why i can easily recommend it as a first miyazaki film; it's perfect for those who have no expectations from having already seen the incredible otherworldliness of some of his more recent works.even the ending song of the film, when translated into english, conveys the sense of longing for the discovery of some kind of lost civilization, and some kind of soulmate, that could not be found in our mundane lives. the reason i long for the many lights is that you are there in one of them...the earth spins, carrying you, carrying us both who'll surely meet. miyazaki has always provided poetic lyrics to make ending songs out of joe hiasashi's gorgeous scores, but this is the only one i've seen that's both a touching love song and an inspirational dream. i have found myself near tears just listening to it.castle in the sky may not be miyazaki's most developed, spectacular, or meaningful work, but it's absolutely perfect for what it really was meant to be: a true vision of childhood fantasy, and a wonderful escape from reality for any adults who wish they could have the same wonderful sense of imagination they had when they were just carefree little kids. sit back, relax, and love it for what it is.\",\n",

       " \"i have to admit that i went into fever pitch with low expectations. it's no huge revelation for me to say that jimmy fallon's last movie (taxi) was catwomanly bad, and the trailers for fever pitch were all right but didn't mesmerize me. i was already preparing some cheesy baseball puns for my review...i like jimmy fallon, but taxi was strike one in his movie career. well, now we've got steeeeeeriiiiiike twoooooooo one more strike, and it's back to snl or buy yourself some peanuts and cracker jacks, but don't buy tickets to fever pitch. you'll walk out of the theater and never go back then the movie had to go and be way more entertaining than i was expecting. but hey, i couldn't let my puns go to waste, right another reason i thought i wouldn't care for the movie is that i hate the boston red sox. my whole family hates 'em. the mere mention of pedro martinez' name sends me running to the bathroom. oh man, hold on......all right, i'm back. anyway, my mom, who is a st. louis cardinals fan, still believes the world series was rigged last year. she refuses to believe the sox won it legitimately. but i'm man enough to admit that fever pitch caused me to sympathize, albeit only slightly, with the plight of red sox fans.anybody who has a passion for sports will be able to relate to this movie on some level. unless you have a favorite sports team you can't fully understand the extreme highs and lows that a fan such as fallon's ben can go through. there's nothing quite so fresh as the smell of a new season and nothing quite so smooth as a clean slate. well, figuratively speaking. it's the joy of being a sports fan. wait 'til next year, becomes your mantra, your motto, your prayer  and fever pitch effectively captures that essence.i love the fact that the movie takes a fictional story and throws it against the reallife backdrop of the red sox' improbable world series run last year. i don't love it so much that i want to marry it, but you know what i mean. i expected this to be handled in a fairly cheesy manner, and while some of the humor is a little silly, it's actually pretty realistic.you see, ben's uncle took him to his first red sox game when he was 7 years old, and when he died he left ben his two season tickets. ben hasn't missed a game in 23 years. at the beginning of each season he has a draft day where he and his friends get together to figure out who gets to go to which games with him. he makes everybody dance for the yankees games and whenever somebody complains he threatens them with tickets for the games with the royals (sorry mr. shade) and the devil rays. it's a very good scene, and it works so well because i actually know of people who do the ticket draft day. i also must admit that i can relate to when ben goes to dinner with lindsey and her parents. the red sox are playing a road game, but instead of watching it live on tv ben decides to tape it. one of the most dangerous things in life is taping a game and then being in public and trying to avoid hearing the result. been there. it's a very tense and scary situation. weeeeeell, ben enters the danger zone when a guy shows up at the restaurant and mentions watching the game. ben immediately covers his ears and starts shrieking like a banshee so as not to hear the outcome. lindsey is embarrassed, and her parents don't know what to think. yeah, sports fans can be weird, i don't deny it. but it's real.now if you're expecting the crude, edgy stuff that the farrelly brothers are known for then you could be disappointed. they do have their moments though, like when ben says he likes how lindsey sometimes talks out of the side of her mouth like an adorable stroke victim, but overall this is definitely a softer, more romantic side that the bros are putting on display.that's not to say that the movie ever gets way too sappy. thankfully, when the sap starts to ooze a bit, the farrellys know when to pull away. a romantic moment with lindsey jumping on the field and running over to ben to declare her undying love for him turns into ben sincerely replying, you've gotta tell me about the outfield. is it spongy jimmy fallon proves that with the right material he can handle himself well on the big screen, and drew barrymore remains a constant source of romantic comedy charm. fever pitch is just good, solid entertainment that takes a somewhat fresh look at the romantic comedy genre. it's a movie that guys and gals can both relate to. particularly the guys who practice sports fanaticism at some point during the year and the ladies who must deal with 'em.now if the red sox fans could please shut up about the curse of the bambino i would appreciate it. my memphis tigers have never won the ncaa basketball championship, so i officially declare my plight greater than yours.the gist fans of jimmy fallon, drew barrymore, romantic comedy, the red sox, baseball, or sports fanaticism in general should consider giving fever pitch a look. i wouldn't go out of my way to rush and see it at the first available time, but it'll make a great matinée.rating: 3.25 (out of 5)\",\n",
       " \"this game is one of the best rpg. fist, it is actually more amusing than any other because of the battle system (you harm the enemy depending on how you aim the attack, you can transform into dragoon, the special attack, the magic...). the script is very good. characters are all lovely and you have no long dialogs to support, as happened in several games of final fintasy series. i got bored of that dialogs about past, when you just want to go on with the game's story. ambientation is a jewel on this game, it combines middleage fantasy with futuristic science fiction. it's remarkable that animation effects are just incredible, i like them more than other in other modern games (we can't remember that legend of the dragoon is 8 years now). then, map is huge, there are all kinds of places an enemies. finally, music is not the best game muse i have heard, but it's perfect for a game like this.\",\n",
       " 'the first episode set the bar quite high i thought. it starred william hurt as a hitman who is contracted to kill a toymaker. we are given very little information on his character or who is paying him to kill, indeed the episode is notable for having no dialogue at all. returning to his modernist penthouse he is delivered a package containing toy soldiers, this gives him a smile but he dismisses it and goes about his business. but he is in for a night of hell, the soldiers are alive and are about to wage war, driving jeeps, shooting machine guns and bazookas and even flying helicopters. the special effects are good for a tv show and it becomes quite tense as he dodges around the apartment using his wits to survive, sometimes getting the upper hand and other times not. i wont spoil the ending but suffice to say it was a clever little twist. this gave me hope for the rest of the series but i was in for a disappointment, the other episodes were all rubbish and i lost interest by the fourth one. stephen king adaptations are always a mixed bag and these are no exception',\n",
       " \"takashi miike's incursion into kiddie territory won me over almost immediately because he demonstrates nerve and bravery in dealing with fantasy elements. this is a fairy tale that dares to be dark. even as a kid, i thought that there was something sinister about most fairy tales; horrible things happen to people in most children's books. miike understands that these classic tales are a bit scarier (and more disturbing) than what they appear to be at first glance. the filmmaker takes the archetypical story of a kid on a wondrous quest out of the preschool classroom. he accentuates the very real fears of a world filled with neverending hazardous missions. westerners like to downplay the seriousness behind bedtime stories written specifically for kids. i appreciated the fact that miike was more honest than most american filmmakers. he goes for the jugular of the story but he also shows signs of restrain. but a selfpossessed miike is still stranger than most filmmakers. i thought it was a great film. highly recommended.\",\n",

       " 'years ago a movie going friend and i went to see a horror film that we thought would be good because it starred john cassavetes. for the uninitiated, john cassavettes was an actor, screen writer and director (married to actress gena rowlands), nominated for oscars three times, who wrote and directed a variety of good lowbudget films using his income as an actor to keep himself afloat. up until seeing the incubus, we did not understand that john cassavetes income was made from any movie that was offered to him. had we known what the film was about before seeing it we may have avoided altogether. but we did not walk out. at the time, my friend and i jokingly indicated it was the worst movie ever made. now frankly, this is not true. i have seen many poorly made films on friday nights on cinemax (did i just say that out loud) that are far worse than the incubus. almost any movie starring brian bosworth is by definition a worse movie than the incubus. certainly santa claus conquers the martians is a worse movie than the incubus. however, i have since consistently used the incubus as a threshold below which i do not want to fall. when talking to this friend about a movie i may have seen i will always remark that it was better (or worse) than the incubus.http:thevillagevideot.blogspot.com',\n",
       " \"i loved kolchak: the night stalker since i saw it on the night it premiered on september 13, 1974. i loved the monsters which seemed scary at the time and the cool music by gil melle (hey, where's the soundtrack guys) and have often thought about what makes this show work for me so completely and have finally concluded that the reason it endures when many others do not is one simple, important element it has that almost no other scary show seems to have and that is a main character that most people can relate to on an everyday level. when darren mcgavin's carl kolchak starts to discover odd situations, he reacts like most people would. he finds them odd and as he gets closer to danger, he is frightened, even if he knows he must move forward to try to defeat whichever menace is being showcased in that episode. it's rare that he is brave enough to stand up against some superior supernatural force. he's usually set a trap and is hiding or waiting in the wings to see if it works. sometimes, he seems as surprised that he managed to defeat a foe as we are. in one episode, he goes to find a monster in a sewer but when he first sees it, he runs to get out of there but is trapped so reluctantly, he must go back and defend himself. he's heroic because he is willing to do things most of us probably wouldn't do but that doesn't mean he probably wouldn't much rather someone else did it instead of him. he's a regular guy, doing a job, trying to make a buck, not a monsterhunter. he just gets wrapped up in things involving the supernatural, which he has an interest in but he doesn't want to be hurt or killed anymore than any of the rest of us do. if his plan to defeat the creature didn't work, you will often see him running for his life to get away from it, which is of course what i would do in the situation. that's why i was often watching the climax of the shows through my fingers as a kid. kolchak was likable and you cared if something bad happened to him. you were scared for him and for the other characters too. the producers and writers obviously knew that anyone can create a monster suit, scary music and direct a suspenseful scene but it's all for naught if you don't care about the characters. darren mcgavin said that the reason why the show only lasted on season was because he got tired of doing a monster of the week show and he decided not to continue. i can tell you i mourned when this show was canceled when i was a kid but, as an adult, i can see why it couldn't go on in that formula for very long. i still love the 20 episodes and two movies that starred mcgavin as the bumbling, determined and brusk but goodhearted reporter for the ins, known as carl kolchak. i seriously doubt anyone who makes shows or movies will ever really understand why i loved the show. it's not the monsters, darklylit sets, creepy music or goofy guest stars, although they are all vital ingredients. the secret to it's success is right there in the title  kolchak: the night stalker. without mcgavin's lovable, bumbling carl kolchak to root for and to care for, then it just ain't a night stalker.\",\n",

(he did but something went wrong with that.) why did he not make it and why did the others give up on their dreams i'll tell you why, it was because they didn't have a father in their life to care and to cheer them on and their mother stopped being their to support their dreams. the show stopped teaching us about growing, building and learning and started teaching us about gimmicks and catch phrases. they should have kept james. if any show needed a father it was that one.\",\n",
       " \"dominick (nicky) luciano wears a 'hulk' tshirt and trudges off everyday to perform his duties as a garbage man. he uses his physical power in picking up other's trash and hauling it to the town dump. he reads comicbook hero stories and loves wrestlers and wrestling, going to wrestlemania with his twin brother eugene on their birthday is a yearly tradition. he talks kindly with the many people he comes in contact with during his day. he reads comic books, which he finds in the trash, with a young boy who he often passes by while on the garbage route. unfortunately, dominick has a diminished ability to use his mind. he has a disability.dominick's disability came as a result of an injury to the head in which he suffered traumatic brain injury (tbi). this injury left him slower, though it did not change his core characteristic as a strong individual who helps to protect others. dominick is actually more able to live independently than he may seem at the beginning of the film. he lives with eugene who is studying to become a doctor. dominick provides the main source of income, while eugene is off studying. eugene must face the fact that he is to continue his education in a different city, and that he must move away from dominick. eugene also develops a romance which begins to separate him from his twin brother.the film deals specifically with domestic abuse and how this can impact individuals, families, and then society as a whole. the strain that escalates between eugene and dominick as eugene realizes that he must eventually leave nicky, exploded on their birthday night. eugene yells at dominick and throws him against the wall. in this moment, eugene must confront his own fears of being like his abusive father, the father which dominick protected him against while he himself became the victim of the abuse. this event cemented the love between the two brothers, who from then on became the best of friends. though they needed each other, they also both needed independence and the ability to grow and develop relationship with others. the fact that they must part ways became a very real emotional strain. however, by the end of the film, dominick is able to say good bye to his brother and wish him luck. eugene is able to leave his brother with the confidence that he has started to make a social network of people who care about him and will help him with his independence.when dominick witnesses the abuse of his friend he is forced to come face to face with the cause of his own trauma. in this state of extreme stress, dominick almost completely shuts down. he then runs after the ambulance to the hospital to see what happened to his friend. after learning that the boy has died, he is confronted by the abusive father who, fearing his testimonial, tells him he didn't see nothing, doesn't know anything, and not to say anything, and that if he does he will kill him. now that his own life has been threatened, he goes and find the hand gun that larry used to kill the rats. he goes to the wake of the deceased boy and at gunpoint, kidnaps the baby of the grieving family. he runs away from the scene and hides in a building. when the police surround him, eugene goes in the building to talk to his brother. eugene then reveals the cause of dominick's disability and they bring the baby back. the abusive father then wields a gun of his own threatening to kill dominick, but eugene stops him and dominick tells the crowd that he saw the father throw his son down the stairs.through the climactic ending, the issue of dysfunctional behavior comes into view. though dominick's instinct to save the baby can be understood, we also see how damaging this response is. dominick put the baby's life and his own life in grave danger. the larger societal consequences of these events is not directly implicated, but rather shown through the films ending. despite the more optimistic ending portrayal, another sequence of events might just have likely occurred, in which dominick is charged with kidnapping and possession of a firearm. it is somewhat difficult to believe that this went completely unaccounted. furthermore, even if dominick is not charged, there may still be a stigma against him within the community, not that there wasn't one before these events. instead, the film shows that we must be able to recognize problematic behavior and act to curb it.dominick and eugene was released in 1988, the same year as another film, rainman, which won 5 academy awards. while rainman was an achievement and helped increase the visibility with person with disabilities, it could be argued that dominick and eugene holds more valuable lessons for society. whereas, rainman demonstrated that mainstream american society might be able to learn from and care for a 'savant', if the 'savant' is the inheritor of a large estate. dominick and eugene show that a person with a disability might be able to care for and help save members of american society. the message of an independent person with disabilities may have been too strong for 1988. hopefully someday society will see the strengths of individuals with disabilities, not as a threat, but as imperative for the strength of society.\",\n",

       " \"house of evil aka dance of death of 1968 is the first of four infamous and odd last movies starring the great boris karloff and directed by jack hill and juan ibánez. unlike snake people (1971), the incredible invasion (also 1971) and the fear chamber (1972) which were all released after karloff's death in 1969, house of evil was released in 1968, when karloff was still alive. house of evil is regarded by many as the worst of these four movies, which are without doubt all rather crappy, but definitely have their entertainment value as the unintentional comedies they are. i personally prefer the fear chamber and house of evil over the other two, simply for the reason that the lack of the slightest logic is even more extreme, and since there is no suspense whatsoever in any of the movies, the lack of logic increases the unintentional fun factor.the odd story (i don't know if i can really call it a 'plot') is set somewhere in europe in the 19th century. after some girls are murdered and found with their eyes ripped out, mathias morteval (karloff), an enthusiastic organ player, invites his few remaining relatives to his bizarre mansion, which is full of eerie toys. his kinfolk includes lucy durant (julissa), who is engaged to one of the police inspectors investigating the murders.i won't give away more of the story, but i can assure you that it is quite bizarre throughout the movie. there are some very funny moments, especially some things karloff's character says. boris karloff was without any doubt one of the most brilliant and important icons of the horror genre who ever lived, and he manages to award this odd movie with a tiny bit of his greatness, and although (or because) his role is (due to a poor script and and directing) in no way scary, it looks like he deliberately plays it with a sense of humor. just like in the movie's successors snake people and the fear chamber, the female lead is once again played by julissa. most of he supporting performances are hilariously amateurish, the cinematography is terrible and the locations and sceneries are beneath contempt. the storyline lacks the least bit of logic and the dialogue often does not make the slightest sense. it is the poor story and dialogue, however, that makes this movie so entertaining to watch. house of evil may be an extremely crappy attempt of a movie, but it is certainly as (unintentionally) funny as it is bad. fans of ed wood's movies should be very amused, i personally found it hilarious. crappy but entertaining nevertheless, and definitely worth watching since there's boris karloff in it and due to the fun factor. 310\",\n",

       " \"when it first came out, this work by the meysels brothers was much criticized and even judged to be exploitation. luckily, it is now hailed as a masterpiece of documentary cinema, especially now that society has been exposed to real exploitation in what is reality television, and the bad evolution of most direct cinema.really, at first, we must say that this isn't really direct cinema, it is more cinema verité. the difference between the two is very slight, but it mainly is the fact that in this documentary, we are made to feel the presence of the meysels brothers, and they do interact with the characters filmed. this as well makes it clear that it is not exploitation. the meysels have been allowed in the house, and they are included in what is a very eccentric situation of a very eccentric household. and both edith and edie just love the idea of being filmed.it would have been very disappointing had very been shown only a voice of god narration and shallow interviews. here, we are given a full portrait of the madness of the house, a madness that does seem to go down well with both edie and her mother edith. their house is a mess, litter and animals everywhere, faded colors and furniture all over the house, and the constant fights that are constant interactions of reality. these two people have lived with each other their whole life, and are not fighting in front of the camera because they want the attention, but rather because they can't help talking to each other this way. they know each other too well to hide their inner feelings, there is no need. in the end, though, even as they blame each other for their lives, they really love each other deeply. edie says she doesn't want her mother to die, because she loves her very much, and edith says that she doesn't want edie to leave her because she doesn't want to be alone.but the most interesting aspect of the film is that regardless of their old age, the two women can't help be girls. they cannot help being one the singer, the other the dancer. exhibit all their artistic skills in front of their camera. when edie asks david meysels rhetorically where have you been all my life she is really very happy that she finally gets to show the whole world herself and her wonderful showgirls skills. a beautiful portrait of stylistic importance and a charm that is highly unlikely to be ever seen again, the way only the meysels and few others could do.\",\n",
       " \"this movie was a mess. it had the absolute worst editing i have ever seen. it was almost like at the end of a scene the writer wanted to go to commercial, and the filmmaker added a second of black screen to fulfill the writers dream.under the messy direction and editing, there was a glimmer of something good. a good idea, a compelling spark. but somewhere it went wrong.the story is about a quasipsychic priest who is trying to solve a string of murders. the first thing that is hard to bite into is richard grieco as a priest. well the part doesn't call for him to be a good priest and he succeeds rather well. the second problem is dennis hopper as the crazy bad guy. he always plays the crazy bad guy. very ho hum.oh, a thought occured to me that maybe all the jumpy, horrible editing and disconnected plot was trying to add a sense of the confusion the character (grieco) was experiencing. and just to prove that it was contrived they rolled the credits backwords. not a good sign for any movie.\",\n",

       " \"this film screened last night at austin's paramount theater as part of the sxsw film festival. we were graced with the presence of director mike binder and stars adam sandler and don cheadle who took audience questions after the film. it is a remarkable and powerful film about what it is like to lose yourself and begin to find your way back. the performances are phenomenal and the story manages to be both tragic and funny in a way that is all too rare. (the trailer for the film tries a little too hard to emphasize the comedic aspects.)this is a breakout role for adam sandler. while he has begun to transition to more dramatic roles with punchdrunk love and spanglish, this role is a significant step forward for him as a dramatic actor. he deserves an oscar nomination as he continues down to transition to more dramatic roles as tom hanks did and jim carrey is also doing. in this role, he seemed to be trying to channel dustin hoffman in rain man. although playing an autistic man is certainly very different than sandler's traumatized character, both characters for different reasons are trapped in their own worlds of childlike isolation and confusion.don cheadle's performance is less surprising, but just as good. after hotel rwanda and crash, we've come to expect remarkable nuanced performances from cheadle. he has the qualities of sincerity and honesty that comes through in this role. but he, too, is also broken and struggling if not in the such profound ways as sandler's character. cheadle is struggling with difficulties in both his marriage and in his professional life as a dentist. together the characters played by cheadle and sandler struggle to heal each other in the way that true friends often do (in a way that reminds me of matt damon and robin williams in good will hunting). they are both searching for that part of the themselves that they have lost and trying to find again.reign over me is one of the best major studio films to be released this year. the soundtrack, which is almost another character in the plot is wonderful. the filming in the streets of new york  a city that suffered a great tragedy and has also had to heal itself  is also quite beautiful. the supporting roles by jada pinkett smith, liv tyler, saffron burrows (in a very odd role), donald sutherland, and mike binder himself are all quite good.writerdirector mike binder has really delivered a story that so many will be able to connect with on numerous levels. this is a story about grief, family, healing, male friendship, mental health, and the meaning of love. reign over me does not disappoint. the film is almost hypnotic as it draws you into the lives of its characters. hollywood would have a much better reputation if it made more characterdriven charming films like reign over me.\",\n",
       " \"first of all, the reason i'm giving this film 2 stars instead of 1 is because at least peter falk gave his usual fantastic performance as lieutenant columbo. he alone can get 10 stars for trying to save this otherwise utterly worthless attempt at making a movie.i was initially all fired up at reading one poster's comment that andrew stevens in this movie gave the performance of his career. to me, it was the abysmal performance by stevens that absolutely ruined this movie, and so i was all prepared to hurl all sorts of insults at the person who made the aforementioned comment. then i thought to myself, what else has stevens done so i checked and, you know, that person was absolutely right. in the 17 years since this columbo movie was made, apparently every one of the 33 projects that stevens has been in since then has been utter crap, so it is doubtful that anybody has even seen the rest of his career.if you like columbo, see every other of the 69 titles before watching this one. do yourself a favor and save the worst for last.\",\n",

       " \"i was unlucky enough to have seen this at the sidewalk film festival. sidewalk as a whole was a disappointment and this movie was the final nail in the coffin. being a devout fan of lewis carroll's 'alice' books i was very excited about this movie's premier, which only made it that much more uncomfortable to watch. normally i'm enthusiastic about modern retellings if they are treated well. usually it's interesting to see the parallels between the past and present within a familiar story. unfortunately this movie was less of a modern retelling and more of a pop culture perversion. the adaptation of the original's characters seemed juvenile and usually proved to be horribly annoying. it probably didn't help that the actors weren't very good either. most performances were ridiculously over the top, which i assume was either due to bad direction or an effort to make up for a bad script. i did not laugh once through out the duration of the film. all of the jokes were outdated references to not so current events that are sure to lose their poignancy as time goes by. really, the only highlight of the film was the opening sequence in which the white rabbit is on his way to meet alice, but even then the score was a poor imitation of danny elfman's work. also, i'd have to say that the conversion of the croquet game into a rave danceoff was awful. it was with out a doubt the low point of the film.what a joke. don't see this movie. after its conclusion i was genuinely angry.\",\n",
       " \"i admit that for the first 20 minutes or so of this film i wasn't entirely sure i was going to sit through the whole thing. like many other people, i found it pretty boring, and i wasn't entirely looking forward to an hour and a half of watching this guy bite icicles and stick them together. however, if you sit through the creation of his first work long enough to see the finished product, you get an idea of how impressive the rest of the film is. i really think it's sad that so many people found this impossibly boring or a retread of ideas done by other artists. rivers and tides is a quiet study of some of the artwork and methods of andy goldsworthy, who makes his art entirely out of things in nature, generally resulting in pieces that will be consumed by nature through the normal process of entropy. it is slow moving and unglamorous, but i think that a lot of the point of the movie is to show that goldsworthy's art does not need any accompaniment in order for it to be appreciated. i've even heard people complain about how he is always talking throughout the movie, rather than just letting nature and his artwork speak for themselves, which i just think is madness.on the other hand, lots of people complain about cds coming with the lyrics written out inside them. a lot of musicians as well think their music should mean whatever the listener wants it to mean without the musician showing the exact lyrics, i guess i'm just the kind of person that believes that i'd like to know what the artist was trying to accomplish with his or her artwork. i can still take it how i want to even if i know what it was meant to do. i can understand not wanting to hear him talk through the movie. he does, after all, lose his train of thought and find himself unable to explain some of his work at more than one occasion, but if you don't want goldsworthy talk about his art while you're watching the film, feel free to turn the sound off. that's like not reading the lyrics if you don't want to know what a musician is singing and would rather interpret the words yourself.i think that andy goldsworthy's work, which i had no idea existed before i watched this movie, is incredibly impressive, and i'm glad that this film was made in order to showcase it. indeed, since his work is generally not the kind that can be transported into a studio, photography is the only medium other than film that can express it, and i really appreciated being able to see the work that goes into his art, and the way that only things from nature are used. whether or not you appreciate certain aspects of how this film is presented, goldsworthy's work is moving enough to overlook that, because the film is not the star, goldsworthy's art is. and given the lack of any music or even the smallest special effects and the slowmoving nature of the film, it seems to me that director thomas riedelsheimer knows that.\",\n",
